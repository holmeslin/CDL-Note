# 1. Digital Transformation with Google Cloud

## 1.1 Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business

### 1.1.1 Innovations,

To understand how the cloud is transforming businesses, it’s important to learn about the basics of cloud and cloud technology.
In this section of the course, you’ll explore: key terms related to the cloud and digital transformation, the benefits of cloud technology with regard to an organization’s
digital transformation, the differences between on-premises infrastructure, public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multicloud, and the drivers and challenges that lead organizations to undergo a digital transformation.
Let’s get started!

### 1.1.2 Innovations, paradigm shifts, and digital transformation - 創新、範式轉移和數位轉型

Innovation doesn’t come in a linear pattern.
創新不是以線性模式出現的。
It comes in waves.
它是以波浪形式出現的。
And each of these waves is powered by a breakthrough technology.
每一波創新浪潮都由突破性技術推動。
There was the age of the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, the transportation age, the first computers and, today, data and cloud infrastructure.
曾經有印刷機時代、蒸汽機時代、電力時代、交通運輸時代、第一代計算機，現在是數據和雲基礎設施的時代。
Each of these inventions triggered thousands of innovations, changing what's possible in life and work.
每一項發明都引發了數千項創新，改變了生活和工作的可能性。
Consider the invention of the printing press.
考慮一下印刷機的發明。
It was revolutionary because it gave everyone access to books, encyclopedias, and even playing cards in their daily lives.
這是一場革命，因為它讓每個人都能在日常生活中接觸到書籍、百科全書，甚至是撲克牌。
It also led to a broader recognition of intellectual property through widely distributed patents, which in turn prepared the world for the first industrial revolution.
它還通過廣泛發行的專利，促進了對知識產權的廣泛認識，這為第一次工業革命做好了準備。
There was no turning back!
從此再也沒有回頭路！
Steam-powered engines brought us cars and trains which then radically transformed the transportation industry; allowing businesses to produce and transport goods at scale.
蒸汽動力引擎帶來了汽車和火車，徹底改變了交通運輸行業；使企業能夠大規模生產和運輸商品。
The entire Industrial Revolution resulted from new technologies that came together and facilitated new ways of working.
整個工業革命是由新技術的融合和促成新工作方式所引發的。
In the same way, electricity brought us the light bulb, household appliances and eventually the computer.
同樣，電力為我們帶來了燈泡、家用電器，最終帶來了計算機。
What the printing press, the steam engine and electricity all have in common is that they’re examples of a paradigm shift: a fundamental and irreversible change in the way that humans work and engage with the world.
印刷機、蒸汽機和電力的共同點是它們都是範式轉移的例子：在人類工作和與世界互動方式上發生了根本性和不可逆的變化。
How do these examples relate to cloud technology?
這些例子與雲技術有什麼關係？
Well, we’re right in the middle of another paradigm shift: one of digital transformation.
我們正處於另一個範式轉移的中間：數位轉型。
Cloud technology is transforming how organizations create value how people work, and ultimately, how people live.
雲技術正在改變組織創造價值的方式、改變人們的工作方式，最終改變人們的生活方式。
It’s the catalyst for thousands of innovations that change how we navigate the world, how we interact with media, how we diagnose illness, or how we combat environmental issues.
它是數千項創新的催化劑，改變了我們探索世界的方式、與媒體互動的方式、診斷疾病的方式以及解決環境問題的方式。
Digital transformation, as a term, has become prominent over the past few years.
數位轉型這個術語在過去幾年中變得越來越顯著。
But what are the key components of a digital transformation, how do they relate to the use of cloud technologies, and why so many organizations pursue it?
但是，數位轉型的關鍵組成部分是什麼，它們與雲技術的使用有何關聯，以及為什麼這麼多組織追求數位轉型？
At Google Cloud, we define digital transformation as when an organization uses new digital technologies, such as public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms to create or modify business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet the needs of changing business and market dynamics.
在 Google Cloud，我們將數位轉型定義為當一個組織使用新的數位技術，例如公共、私有和混合雲平台來創建或修改業務流程、文化和客戶體驗，以滿足不斷變化的業務和市場動態需求。
Organizations choose digital transformation frameworks to foster innovation, generate new revenue streams, and adapt quickly to market changes and customer needs.
組織選擇數位轉型框架來促進創新、創造新的收入來源，並快速適應市場變化和客戶需求。
Digital transformation helps organizations change how they operate and redefine relationships with their customers, employees, and partners by modernizing their applications, creating new services, and delivering value.
數位轉型通過現代化其應用程序、創建新服務並提供價值，幫助組織改變其運作方式，重新定義與客戶、員工和合作夥伴的關係。
For that reason, rapid advances in digital technology are redefining every industry.
因此，數位技術的快速進步正在重新定義每個行業。
Many vehicles are now software-driven, and they receive regular updates much like a laptop or phone.
許多車輛現在由軟件驅動，並定期更新，就像筆記本電腦或手機一樣。
In chemistry, big data and artificial intelligence (or AI) facilitates drug discovery.
在化學領域，大數據和人工智能（或 AI）促進了藥物發現。
Financial service institutions use cloud’s vast computing power to provide better insights than ever before.
金融服務機構利用雲的強大計算能力提供前所未有的洞察力。
With smart analytics that are increasingly embedded in everything and devices that generate exponential amounts of data traditional on-premises computing solutions can no longer suffice.
隨著智能分析越來越多地嵌入一切，設備生成的數據呈指數增長，傳統的本地計算解決方案已經不再足夠。
As business innovation becomes more driven by software, the IDC FutureScape report predicts that over 50% of all IT spending will go toward digital transformation and innovation by 2024.
隨著業務創新越來越多地由軟件驅動，IDC FutureScape 報告預測，到 2024 年，超過 50%的 IT 支出將用於數位轉型和創新。
In fact, IDC also predicts that, by 2025, more than 90% of new enterprise apps will have AI embedded within them.
事實上，IDC 還預測，到 2025 年，超過 90%的新企業應用程序將嵌入 AI。
Leading organizations will rely more heavily on AI to launch new business models, create more customized experiences, and optimize operations to reduce costs.
領先的組織將更依賴 AI 來推出新的業務模式，創造更多定制化體驗，並優化運營以降低成本。
Understanding the scale and power of the cloud is more critical than ever before.
了解雲的規模和力量比以往任何時候都更加重要。

### 1.1.3 What is the cloud

So what is the cloud and cloud technology, exactly?
那麼，雲和雲技術到底是什麼？
And how does it support digital transformation?
它如何支持數位轉型？
The cloud is a metaphor for the network of data centers which store and compute information that’s available through the internet.
雲是對數據中心網絡的隱喻，這些數據中心存儲和計算可通過互聯網獲取的信息。
Essentially, instead of describing a complex web of software, servers, computers, networks, and security systems, all of that has been combined into one word: the cloud.
本質上，與其描述一個由軟件、服務器、計算機、網絡和安全系統組成的複雜網絡，不如將這一切合併成一個詞：雲。
To better understand the cloud, it might help to explore the different ways organizations can implement their information technology (or IT) infrastructure.
為了更好地理解雲，可能需要探討組織實施其信息技術（或 IT）基礎設施的不同方式。
The list includes on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, and multicloud implementations.
該列表包括本地、私有雲、公共雲、混合雲和多雲的實施方式。
On-premises IT infrastructure, which is often abbreviated to “on-prem,” refers to hardware and software applications that are hosted on-site, located and operated within an organization's data center to serve their unique needs.
本地 IT 基礎設施，通常縮寫為“on-prem”，是指在現場托管的硬件和軟件應用程序，位於組織的數據中心內，並由其運營以滿足其獨特需求。
This implementation is the traditional way of managing IT infrastructure.
這種實施方式是管理 IT 基礎設施的傳統方式。
The benefit of on-premises is that it doesn’t require third-party access which gives owners physical control over the server hardware and software and doesn’t require them to pay for ongoing access.
本地的好處在於它不需要第三方訪問，這使得擁有者對服務器硬件和軟件擁有物理控制權，並且不需要支付持續的訪問費用。
However, to have the computing power to run their required workloads, organizations must buy physical servers and other infrastructure through procurement processes that can take months.
然而，為了擁有運行所需工作負載的計算能力，組織必須通過採購過程購買物理服務器和其他基礎設施，這可能需要數月時間。
These systems require physical space, typically a specialized room with sufficient power and cooling.
這些系統需要物理空間，通常是一個具有足夠電力和冷卻的專用房間。
After configuring and deploying the systems, businesses then need expert personnel to manage them.
在配置和部署系統之後，企業還需要專業人員來管理它們。
This long process is difficult to scale when demand spikes or business expands.
當需求激增或業務擴展時，這個漫長的過程難以擴展。
Organizations often acquire more computing resources than they actually need, which results in low utilization and high overhead.
組織經常獲得比實際需要更多的計算資源，這導致了低利用率和高開銷。
Cloud computing addresses these issues by offering computing resources as scalable, on-demand services.
雲計算通過提供可擴展的按需服務的計算資源來解決這些問題。
A private cloud is a type of cloud computing where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization instead of the general public.
私有雲是一種雲計算類型，其基礎設施專用於單一組織，而不是公眾。
This type is also known as single-tenant or corporate cloud.
這種類型也稱為單租戶或企業雲。
Typically, an organization has to perform the same kind of ongoing maintenance and management for a private cloud as it would for traditional on-premises infrastructure.
通常，組織需要對私有雲進行與傳統本地基礎設施相同類型的持續維護和管理。
A private cloud is hosted within an organization’s own private servers, either at an organization’s own data center, at a third-party colocation facility, or by using a private cloud provider.
私有雲託管在組織自己的私有服務器中，這些服務器可以位於組織自己的數據中心、第三方託管設施，或者通過私有雲提供商進行託管。
Private cloud computing gives businesses many of the benefits of a public cloud—including self-service, scalability, and elasticity—with more customization available from dedicated on-premises infrastructure.
私有雲計算為企業提供了許多公共雲的優勢，包括自助服務、可擴展性和彈性，並且可以通過專用的本地基礎設施提供更多自定義選項。
Organizations might use private cloud if they have already made significant investments in their own infrastructure or if, for regulatory reasons, data must be kept on-premises or hosted in a certain way.
如果組織已經在其自身的基礎設施上進行了大量投資，或者由於監管原因，數據必須保存在本地或以特定方式托管，則它們可能會使用私有雲。
The public cloud is where on-demand computing services and infrastructure are managed by a third-party provider, such as Google Cloud, and shared with multiple organizations or “tenants” through the public internet.
公共雲是指按需計算服務和基礎設施由第三方提供商（如 Google Cloud）管理，並通過公共互聯網與多個組織或“租戶”共享。
This sharing is why public cloud is known as multi-tenant cloud infrastructure, but each tenant’s data and applications running in the cloud are hidden from other tenants.
這種共享是公共雲被稱為多租戶雲基礎設施的原因，但每個租戶在雲中運行的數據和應用程序對其他租戶是隱藏的。
You can think of it like an apartment building that’s maintained by a property management company.
您可以將其想像成一棟由物業管理公司維護的公寓樓。
The building has many units and tenants.
這棟樓有很多單位和租戶。
Each unit might have a slightly different layout, but still has all the amenities a tenant needs to live there.
每個單位的佈局可能略有不同，但仍具有租戶所需的所有設施。
And each unit is locked and private to the tenant who pays for that space.
每個單位都是鎖定的，並且對支付該空間的租戶是私密的。
In these lessons, when we refer to “cloud,” unless otherwise stated, we’re talking about the public cloud.
在這些課程中，當我們提到“雲”時，除非另有說明，否則我們指的是公共雲。
Because public cloud has on-demand availability of computing and infrastructure resources, organizations don't need to acquire, configure, or manage those resources themselves, and they only pay for what they use.
由於公共雲按需提供計算和基礎設施資源，組織不需要自己獲取、配置或管理這些資源，它們只需支付所使用的資源費用。
There are typically three types of cloud computing service models available in public cloud: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
公共雲中通常有三種類型的雲計算服務模型：基礎設施即服務（IaaS）、平台即服務（PaaS）和軟件即服務（SaaS）。
The second is platform as a service (PaaS), which offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps.
第二種是平台即服務（PaaS），它提供一個開發和部署環境來構建雲應用程序。
And the third is software as a service (SaaS), which delivers apps as services, where users get access to software on a subscription basis.
第三種是軟件即服務（SaaS），它將應用程序作為服務交付，用戶可以通過訂閱訪問軟件。
We’ll explore these three models in detail later.
我們將在後面詳細探討這三種模型。
The final two ways that organizations can implement IT infrastructure is hybrid cloud or multi-cloud.
組織實施 IT 基礎設施的最後兩種方式是混合雲或多雲。
Although they’re not the same, these two terms are often used interchangeably, so let's take a moment to define them.
雖然它們不是同一個概念，但這兩個術語經常互換使用，所以讓我們花點時間來定義它們。
In a hybrid cloud, applications run in a combination of different environments.
在混合雲中，應用程序在不同環境的組合中運行。
The most common hybrid cloud example is combining a public and private cloud environment, like an on-premises data center and a public cloud computing environment, like Google Cloud.
最常見的混合雲例子是將公共和私有雲環境結合在一起，例如本地數據中心和公共雲計算環境，例如 Google Cloud。
The term multicloud describes architectures that combine at least two public cloud providers.
多雲這個術語描述的是結合至少兩個公共雲提供商的架構。
Organizations might operate a combination of on-premises and multiple public cloud environments, therefore implementing both hybrid and multicloud simultaneously.
組織可能運營本地和多個公共雲環境的組合，因此同時實施混合雲和多雲。
So, although hybrid cloud and multicloud are related, they aren’t interchangeable terms.
因此，儘管混合雲和多雲是相關的，但它們不是可以互換的術語。
Today, most organizations embrace a multicloud strategy.
今天，大多數組織採用多雲策略。
According to the “Flexera 2022 State of the Cloud Report,” 89% of respondents reported having a multicloud strategy, and 80% of them take a hybrid approach by combining public and private cloud.
根據《Flexera 2022 年雲狀態報告》，89%的受訪者報告採用了多雲策略，其中 80%的人通過結合公共和私有雲採取混合方法。

### 1.1.4 The benefits of cloud computing

So, what are the benefits of cloud computing compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure?
那麼，雲計算相比於傳統的本地基礎設施有什麼優勢？
It's scalable.
它具有可擴展性。
Cloud computing gives organizations access to scalable resources and the latest technologies on-demand, so they don't need to worry about capital expenditures or limited fixed infrastructure.
雲計算使組織能夠按需訪問可擴展的資源和最新技術，無需擔心資本支出或有限的固定基礎設施。
This can significantly accelerate infrastructure deployment time.
這可以大大加快基礎設施的部署時間。
It's flexible.
它具有靈活性。
Organizations and their users can access cloud services from anywhere scaling services up or down as needed to meet business requirements.
組織及其用戶可以從任何地方訪問雲服務，根據需要擴展或縮減服務，以滿足業務需求。
It's agile.
它具有敏捷性。
Organizations can develop new applications and rapidly get them into production, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
組織可以開發新應用程序並迅速投入生產，而無需擔心底層基礎設施。
It offers strategic value.
它具有戰略價值。
Because cloud providers stay updated with the latest innovations and offer them as services to customers, organizations can get more competitive advantages and a higher return on investment—than if they'd invested in soon-to-be obsolete technologies.
由於雲服務提供商會跟上最新的創新並將其作為服務提供給客戶，組織可以獲得更多的競爭優勢和更高的投資回報，而不是投資於即將過時的技術。
This lets organizations innovate and try new ideas faster.
這使得組織能夠更快地創新和嘗試新想法。
It's secure.
它是安全的。
Cloud computing security is recognized as stronger than that in enterprise data centers, because of the depth and breadth of the security mechanisms and dedicated teams that cloud providers implement.
雲計算的安全性被認為比企業數據中心更強，因為雲服務提供商實施的安全機制的深度和廣度以及專門的團隊。
Finally, it's cost-effective.
最後，它具有成本效益。
No matter which cloud computing service model organizations implement, they only pay for the computing resources they use.
無論組織實施哪種雲計算服務模型，它們只需支付所使用的計算資源費用。
They don't need to overbuild data center capacity to handle sudden spikes in demand or business growth, and they can deploy IT staff to work on more strategic initiatives.
它們不需要過度建設數據中心容量來應對需求的突然增加或業務增長，並且可以部署 IT 人員來從事更具戰略意義的計劃。

### 1.1.5 Real-world examples: Why it’s critical to transform and embrace new technology

As the world and business change, keeping technology the same instead of being open to transforming is risky for an organization.
隨著世界和業務的變化，保持技術不變而不願意轉型對組織來說是有風險的。
Let's illustrate this by looking at two examples: one embraces new technology and uses it to their advantage, and the other doesn't.
讓我們通過兩個例子來說明：一個擁抱新技術並利用它來獲取優勢，另一個則沒有。
First up is Nintendo.
首先是任天堂。
Nintendo has been creating games since 1889!
任天堂自 1889 年以來一直在創造遊戲！
They started with traditional Japanese playing cards, called Hanafuda, which were made possible by the printing press.
他們從傳統的日本撲克牌——花札開始，這是由印刷機實現的。
From there, they have consistently used new technology to transform their business, and become a leader in the gaming industry.
從那時起，他們不斷利用新技術轉型業務，成為遊戲行業的領導者。
They were even among the first to introduce gaming consoles and mobile gaming devices.
他們甚至是最早推出遊戲主機和移動遊戲設備的公司之一。
Still, they didn't just stop after these successes.
然而，他們並沒有在這些成功之後停下腳步。
Instead, they revolutionized mobile gaming when they launched Pokemon Go in 2016, and then the first cloud gaming console—Nintendo Switch—one year later in 2017.
相反，他們在 2016 年推出 Pokemon Go 時革命性地改變了移動遊戲，並在 2017 年推出第一款雲遊戲主機——Nintendo Switch。
At a time when most of their competitors were failing, Nintendo transformed by using one new technology after the next, consistently maintaining and even expanding its market share and customer base along the way.
在大多數競爭對手失敗的時候，任天堂通過不斷使用新技術進行轉型，持續保持並甚至擴大其市場份額和客戶群。
More recently, Nintendo has been using Google Cloud to bring games to smartphones worldwide.
最近，任天堂一直在使用 Google Cloud 將遊戲帶到全球的智能手機上。
So, what makes Nintendo so successful at transforming?
那麼，任天堂在轉型方面如此成功的原因是什麼？
The answer is that they consistently focus on “why” they exist, not “how” they operate.
答案是他們始終專注於“為什麼”他們存在，而不是“如何”運營。
They exist because they want people to play, and naturally, they'll use any new technology as a resource to achieve this mission.
他們存在是因為他們希望人們玩耍，並且自然地，他們會使用任何新技術作為資源來實現這一使命。
If they focused on liquid crystal displays as the best tool for gaming, then each new technology would have posed a threat to them.
如果他們專注於液晶顯示器作為遊戲的最佳工具，那麼每一項新技術都會對他們構成威脅。
Instead, they utilized liquid crystal displays for a while, and then quickly shifted as the next technology became available to continue motivating people to play.
相反，他們使用了一段時間的液晶顯示器，然後隨著下一項技術的出現迅速轉變，以繼續激勵人們玩耍。
By contrast, companies that sold encyclopedias, for example, all focused on "how" they operate (how to print and sell a specific set of books).
相比之下，出售百科全書的公司，例如，都專注於“如何”運營（如何印刷和銷售特定的一套書籍）。
And this was what they were proud of: a beautiful set of leather-bound books lined up on the shelves of the finest libraries.
這是他們自豪的地方：一套漂亮的皮革裝訂書籍排列在最好的圖書館的書架上。
And because of their high cost, only a few scholars or the elite could afford them.
由於成本高昂，只有少數學者或精英能夠負擔得起。
For businesses that made and sold encyclopedias, they needed printing presses, well-kept warehouses, bookshelf makers, a way to ship and receive heavy containers, and a good door-to-door selling model.
對於製造和銷售百科全書的企業來說，他們需要印刷機、保持良好的倉庫、書架製造商、運輸和接收重型容器的方法以及良好的上門銷售模式。
These companies were so focused on manufacturing books that they lost sight of their initial mission: to capture, catalog, and share human knowledge.
這些公司如此專注於製造書籍，以至於他們忽略了最初的使命：捕捉、編目和分享人類知識。
When new technology such as CD-ROMs became available, this short-term mindset led many of the original encyclopedia companies to view the technology as a threat to their business instead of an opportunity.
當 CD-ROM 等新技術出現時，這種短期思維導致許多原始的百科全書公司將技術視為對其業務的威脅，而不是機會。
Ironically, many of the CD-ROM-based encyclopedia providers made the exact same mistake, and were later overtaken by cloud-based applications such as Wikipedia or traditional encyclopedia companies, such as Britannica, which moved online.
具有諷刺意味的是，許多基於 CD-ROM 的百科全書提供商犯了同樣的錯誤，後來被基於雲的應用程序（如 Wikipedia）或在線化的傳統百科全書公司（如 Britannica）所超越。
Nintendo and encyclopedia companies were both born from the printing era; Nintendo began with traditional playing cards, and encyclopedias stemmed from hard copy books.
任天堂和百科全書公司都誕生於印刷時代；任天堂從傳統撲克牌開始，百科全書源於紙質書籍。
Because they reacted to technological innovations differently, they experienced different outcomes.
由於他們對技術創新的反應不同，他們經歷了不同的結果。
The reality is that digital transformation is an ongoing process, not a one-time effort.
事實是，數位轉型是一個持續的過程，而不是一次性的努力。
Today, countless industries around the world are disrupted by digitalization: from healthcare to entertainment, from retail to manufacturing.
今天，全球無數行業因數位化而受到顛覆：從醫療保健到娛樂，從零售到製造業。
It's critical that organizations embrace new technology as an opportunity to evolve, serve their customers better, and gain a competitive advantage.
組織必須將新技術視為進化、為客戶提供更好服務並獲取競爭優勢的機會，這至關重要。
This is where cloud computing plays a significant role.
這就是雲計算發揮重要作用的地方。

### 1.1.6 Cloud eras

To understand the cloud computing landscape today and what true digital transformation looks like, we should first understand how we got here.
要了解當今的雲計算格局以及真正的數位轉型是什麼樣子，我們應該首先了解我們是如何走到這一步的。

It started with the VM cloud era.
這一切始於 VM 雲時代。

VM stands for virtual machine.
VM 代表虛擬機器。

New organizations, mostly startups, realized that they could forgo ever buying or operating hardware and just start in the cloud.
新組織，主要是初創公司，意識到他們可以放棄購買或運營硬件，直接在雲中啟動。

This was a major catalyst for many of the great cloud-native companies that we all rely on today, such as Twitter, Spotify, and PayPal.
這是許多我們今天所依賴的偉大的雲原生公司的主要催化劑，例如 Twitter、Spotify 和 PayPal。

By the end of this first VM cloud era, very few startups operated their own data centers.
在這第一個 VM 雲時代結束時，幾乎沒有初創公司運營自己的數據中心。

Next was the infrastructure cloud era, which is when organizations migrated their IT infrastructure to the cloud.
接下來是基礎設施雲時代，這時組織將其 IT 基礎設施遷移到雲中。

This migration saved costs because infrastructure could scale up and down more quickly and easily.
這次遷移節省了成本，因為基礎設施可以更快更容易地擴展和縮減。

Faster development was possible because companies didn't need long-term infrastructure planning and security was better.
更快的開發是可能的，因為公司不需要長期的基礎設施規劃，並且安全性更好。

Also, reducing the management load on IT staff let organizations direct more people and resources to focus on building new capabilities.
此外，減少 IT 人員的管理負擔，使組織能夠將更多的人員和資源用於構建新功能。

In this last decade of the infrastructure cloud, companies that ignored this migration were left trailing behind.
在基礎設施雲的最後十年裡，忽視這次遷移的公司被遠遠拋在後面。

Although the return on investment of these early cloud migrations was important, it didn't provide compelling transformative or disruptive results or fundamentally change how people worked outside of IT.
儘管這些早期雲遷移的投資回報很重要，但它並沒有提供令人信服的變革性或顛覆性結果，也沒有從根本上改變人們在 IT 之外的工作方式。

This is because digital transformation is more than simply migrating and shifting systems to the cloud for cost saving and convenience.
這是因為數位轉型不僅僅是將系統遷移到雲中以節省成本和提高便利性。

As we look ahead, reinventing the future means changing not only where business is done, but how it is done.
展望未來，重塑未來意味著改變的不僅是業務的所在地，還有業務的執行方式。

It requires maximizing the benefits of the cloud and building an environment that enables every person, process, and technology to bring the highest level of innovation to the business.
這需要最大化雲的優勢，並構建一個使每個人、流程和技術能夠為業務帶來最高創新水平的環境。

This is what brings us to the transformation cloud era, where organizations are not just making infrastructure decisions, but are truly focusing on transforming.
這就是我們進入轉型雲時代的原因，在這個時代，組織不僅僅是在做基礎設施決策，而是真正專注於轉型。

Digitalization is now fundamental, and this era is about spreading transformation among all teams in an organization.
數位化現在是基礎，這個時代的重點是將轉型擴展到組織中的所有團隊。

To facilitate this degree of constant innovation and progress, today's most ambitious organizations are building transformation clouds.
為了促進這種持續的創新和進步，當今最有雄心的組織正在構建轉型雲。

A transformation cloud is a new approach to digital transformation.
轉型雲是一種數位轉型的新方法。

It provides an environment for app and infrastructure modernization, data democratization, people connections, and trusted transactions.
它提供了一個應用和基礎設施現代化、數據民主化、人際連接和可信交易的環境。

It's built on an easy-to-use platform with customized industry solutions that gives organizations the confidence that they are saving money and creating a more sustainable future for everyone.
它建立在一個易於使用的平台上，具有定制的行業解決方案，使組織相信他們在節省成本並為每個人創造一個更可持續的未來。

The result is an organization that benefits from cloud computing to drive innovation, generate new revenue streams, and adapt quickly to market changes and customer needs.
其結果是一個受益於雲計算的組織，能夠推動創新，創造新的收入來源，並迅速適應市場變化和客戶需求。

### 1.1.7 Challenges that lead to a digital transformation

A major indicator for organizations that are accelerating their innovation is how they think about transformation.
加速創新的組織的一個主要指標是他們如何看待轉型。

Instead of asking infrastructure questions about where their apps and services should run, they ask transformation questions about how to build an environment that helps every person, process, and technology to adapt to changing business needs.
他們不是在問應用程序和服務應該在哪裡運行的基礎設施問題，而是在問如何構建一個環境，幫助每個人、流程和技術適應不斷變化的業務需求的轉型問題。

So, what are the types of problems and questions that make organizations undergo a digital transformation?
那麼，哪些類型的問題和問題會促使組織進行數位轉型？

At Google, when we talk to our customers about their biggest business challenges and what they need to accelerate digital transformation, we consistently hear five themes.
在 Google，我們與客戶討論他們最大的業務挑戰和加速數位轉型所需的東西時，我們始終聽到五個主題。

First, they want to be the best at understanding and using data.
首先，他們希望在理解和使用數據方面做到最好。

Today, organizations must unify data across streams, lakes, warehouses, and databases so that they can quickly and easily break down data silos, generate real-time insights, and make better business decisions; thus reducing cost and inefficiencies.
如今，組織必須統一跨數據流、數據湖、數據倉庫和數據庫的數據，以便他們能夠快速輕鬆地打破數據孤島，生成實時洞察力，並做出更好的業務決策；從而降低成本和提高效率。

Second, they want the best technology infrastructure.
其次，他們希望擁有最好的技術基礎設施。

Organizations are looking for a cloud platform that will serve as their foundation for growth and has the flexibility to innovate securely and adapt quickly based on market needs.
組織正在尋找一個雲平台，作為他們增長的基礎，並具有安全創新和根據市場需求快速適應的靈活性。

Third, they want to create the best hybrid workplace.
第三，他們希望創建最佳的混合工作場所。

The fundamental shift in how and where we work requires new, stronger connections and collaboration, and many interactions that took place in person have been digitized.
我們工作方式和地點的根本變化需要新的、更強的連接和協作，許多面對面的互動已經數位化。

This change requires more intentional connections and collaboration.
這種變化需要更有意圖的連接和協作。

Fourth, it's critical for organizations to know that their data, systems, and users are secure.
第四，組織知道他們的數據、系統和用戶是安全的，這一點至關重要。

The digital world is seeing more severe security issues, so now companies are rethinking their security posture.
數位世界正在面臨更嚴重的安全問題，所以現在公司正在重新考慮他們的安全姿態。

They must find ways to identify and protect everything from people to data and transactions in a fast-changing environment.
他們必須找到方法來識別和保護從人到數據和交易在快速變化的環境中的一切。

Finally, organizations are prioritizing sustainability as a critical, board-level topic.
最後，組織將可持續性作為一個關鍵的董事會級別話題。

They want to create a more sustainable future through products and services that minimize environmental impact.
他們希望通過最小化環境影響的產品和服務創造一個更可持續的未來。

These are the top drivers for digital transformation that we see, and the challenges that many organizations face as they navigate their journey.
這些是我們看到的數位轉型的主要驅動因素，也是許多組織在其旅程中面臨的挑戰。

### 1.1.8 Google's Transformation Cloud

There are five primary capabilities that form the basis of the transformation cloud.
構建轉型雲的五個主要能力。

They are: Data, Open infrastructure, Collaboration, Trust, and sustainable technology and solutions.
它們是：數據、開放基礎設施、協作、信任和可持續技術與解決方案。

Let's explore each, starting with the data cloud.
讓我們逐一探討，從數據雲開始。

Data is the key to unlocking value from AI, making it critical for innovation and differentiation.
數據是解鎖 AI 價值的關鍵，對於創新和差異化至關重要。

But becoming a data-driven company can be difficult if datasets are siloed across operational and analytical data stores.
但如果數據集在操作和分析數據存儲中被孤立，成為數據驅動的公司可能會很困難。

According to the NewVantage Partners' Data and AI Executive Survey 2022, only 26.5% of companies have succeeded in creating a data-driven organization, to realize tangible and measurable value from their data.
根據 NewVantage Partners 2022 年的數據和 AI 高管調查，只有 26.5%的公司成功建立了數據驅動的組織，從數據中實現了可見和可衡量的價值。

A data cloud is a unified solution to manage data across the entire data lifecycle, regardless of whether it sits in Google Cloud or in other clouds.
數據雲是一種統一的解決方案，可以在整個數據生命周期中管理數據，無論它位於 Google Cloud 還是其他雲中。

It lets organizations identify and process data with great scale, speed, security, and reliability.
它使組織能夠以大規模、快速、安全和可靠的方式識別和處理數據。

Leading companies like Ford, Spotify, Wayfair, and UPS use a data cloud to encourage data-driven transformation quickly, securely, and at scale, all with AI built in.
福特、Spotify、Wayfair 和 UPS 等領先公司使用數據雲來快速、安全且大規模地推動數據驅動的轉型，並內置 AI。

Next up is the open infrastructure.
接下來是開放基礎設施。

Organizations choose to modernize their IT systems on Google's open infrastructure cloud because it gives them freedom to securely innovate and scale from on-premises, to edge, to cloud on an easy, transformative, and open platform.
組織選擇在 Google 的開放基礎設施雲上現代化其 IT 系統，因為它使他們能夠在一個簡單、變革性和開放的平台上，自由地從本地到邊緣再到雲進行安全創新和擴展。

Open infrastructure cloud brings Google Cloud services to different physical locations, while leaving the operation, governance, and evolution of the services to Google Cloud.
開放基礎設施雲將 Google Cloud 服務帶到不同的物理位置，同時將服務的運營、治理和演進交給 Google Cloud。

Instead of relying on a single service provider or closed technology stack, today most organizations want the freedom to run applications in the place that makes the most sense, using hybrid and multicloud approaches based on open source software.
今天，大多數組織希望自由地在最合適的地方運行應用程序，而不是依賴單一的服務提供商或封閉的技術堆棧，使用基於開源軟件的混合和多雲方法。

An open infrastructure cloud facilitates faster innovation and reduces lock-in to a single cloud provider by giving organizations the choice to build, migrate, and manage their applications across on-premises and multiple clouds.
開放基礎設施雲促進更快的創新，通過為組織提供在本地和多個雲中構建、遷移和管理其應用程序的選擇，減少對單一雲提供商的依賴。

Let's take a moment to define two terms that are often confused: open standard and open source.
讓我們花點時間來定義兩個經常混淆的術語：開放標準和開源。

Open standard refers to software that follows particular specifications that are openly accessible and usable by anyone.
開放標準是指遵循特定規範的軟件，這些規範是公開可訪問和可使用的。

They have guidelines for software functionality, which help avoid vendor lock-in and ensure that the products that use these standards perform in an interoperable way.
它們有軟件功能的指南，有助於避免供應商鎖定，並確保使用這些標準的產品以互操作的方式運行。

Examples of open standards are HTTP for requesting content on the web or XML for storing structured data.
開放標準的例子有 HTTP（用於在網上請求內容）或 XML（用於存儲結構化數據）。

Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly accessible and free for anyone to use, modify, and share.
開源是指源代碼公開可訪問並免費供任何人使用、修改和共享的軟件。

A decentralized community generally develops open source software as a public collaboration, based on a philosophy of transparency and the open exchange of ideas.
一個去中心化的社區通常基於透明和開放交換思想的理念，作為公共協作開發開源軟件。

Open source plays a critical role in an open cloud to deliver customers the portability they expect.
開源在開放雲中發揮著關鍵作用，為客戶提供他們期望的可移植性。

Google has a long history of sharing technology through open source: from projects like Kubernetes, which is now the industry standard in container interoperability in the cloud, to TensorFlow, a platform to help everyone develop and train machine learning models.
Google 在通過開源共享技術方面有著悠久的歷史：從 Kubernetes 這樣的項目（現在是雲中容器互操作性的行業標準）到 TensorFlow（一個幫助每個人開發和訓練機器學習模型的平台）。

Another way we provide flexibility is through hybrid and multicloud environments managed by products like Anthos, which is built on open technologies like Kubernetes, Istio, and Knative.
我們提供靈活性的另一種方式是通過由 Anthos 等產品管理的混合和多雲環境，這些產品基於 Kubernetes、Istio 和 Knative 等開放技術構建。

And finally, an open infrastructure embraces a partner ecosystem—and the breadth of solutions it can offer its customers—instead of competing with it.
最後，開放基礎設施擁抱合作夥伴生態系統及其能夠為客戶提供的廣泛解決方案，而不是與之競爭。

Collaboration helps transform how people connect, create, and collaborate.
協作有助於改變人們連接、創造和協作的方式。

A transformation cloud isn't just about technology.
轉型雲不僅僅是關於技術。

People and culture are just as important.
人和文化同樣重要。

Organizations have increased both location and time flexibility in work arrangements since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and hybrid work is here to stay.
自 COVID-19 大流行開始以來，組織在工作安排中的地點和時間靈活性都增加了，混合工作方式將持續存在。

With the definition of the workplace forever changed, it's essential that information and frontline workers across regions and industries connect, create, and collaborate securely from anywhere, and on any device.
隨著工作場所的定義發生永久性變化，跨地區和行業的信息和一線工作者從任何地方、使用任何設備安全地連接、創造和協作是至關重要的。

This new hybrid work environment needs to support a mix of in-person and remote interactions, including immersive digital and mobile experiences.
這種新的混合工作環境需要支持面對面和遠程互動的混合，包括沉浸式數位和移動體驗。

At Google, for example, we offer a collaboration cloud through Google Workspace.
例如，在 Google，我們通過 Google Workspace 提供協作雲。

Workspace brings together communication and collaboration apps including Gmail, Chat, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Meet into a people-first experience powered by Google AI.
Workspace 將包括 Gmail、Chat、Calendar、Drive、Docs、Sheets 和 Meet 在內的通信和協作應用程序匯集在一起，提供由 Google AI 支持的以人為本的體驗。

A trusted cloud helps organizations protect what's important with advanced security tools.
可信雲通過先進的安全工具幫助組織保護重要的東西。

According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the annual cost of cyber crime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025.
根據 Cybersecurity Ventures 的數據，到 2025 年，網絡犯罪的年度成本預計將達到 10.5 萬億美元。

Due to the rise of cybersecurity threats, every company is rethinking its security posture.
由於網絡安全威脅的增加，每家公司都在重新考慮其安全姿態。

This means finding ways to identify and protect everything, from people to customers to data and transactions—in a fast-changing environment.
這意味著在快速變化的環境中，找到識別和保護從人到客戶再到數據和交易的一切的方法。

Organizations see the cloud as more secure than on-premises, and they want to make it simple so that employees, customers, and contractors can safely access their services.
組織認為雲比本地更安全，他們希望簡化流程，以便員工、客戶和承包商可以安全地訪問他們的服務。

They want to create better visibility to find, analyze, resist, and remediate threats at global scale, and benefit from cloud innovations while maintaining control of their digital assets.
他們希望創建更好的可見性，以在全球範圍內發現、分析、抵抗和修復威脅，並在控制其數位資產的同時受益於雲創新。

Finally, a transformation cloud is built on a sustainable foundation, using technology and solutions that help organizations build and work more sustainably.
最後，轉型雲建立在可持續的基礎上，使用技術和解決方案幫助組織構建和更可持續地工作。

Today, organizations are now encouraged to help create a cleaner, more sustainable world and they need new technologies that help them progress consistently.
今天，組織被鼓勵幫助創造一個更清潔、更可持續的世界，他們需要新的技術來幫助他們持續進步。

According to IDC, cloud computing is estimated to save 1 billion metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2024.
根據 IDC 的數據，雲計算預計到 2024 年將節省 10 億公噸的二氧化碳排放量。

The largest corporations have the opportunity to lead the way in helping the world reduce its emissions and operate on carbon-free energy always.
最大的公司有機會在幫助世界減少排放和始終使用無碳能源方面引領潮流。

For that reason, companies are moving to the cloud, and they want a sustainable infrastructure to power their business.
出於這個原因，公司正在轉向雲端，他們希望有一個可持續的基礎設施來推動他們的業務。

At Google Cloud, for example, we partner with customers to decarbonize their digital apps and infrastructure with our sustainable technology and solutions.
例如，在 Google Cloud，我們與客戶合作，通過我們的可持續技術和解決方案使其數位應用和基礎設施脫碳。

We proudly operate the cleanest cloud in the industry, with the smartest data centers that are 2 times as energy-efficient as a typical enterprise data center.
我們自豪地運營行業中最清潔的雲，擁有最智能的數據中心，其能源效率是典型企業數據中心的兩倍。

Moving to Google Cloud can dramatically decrease a customer's IT-related carbon footprint.
轉向 Google Cloud 可以顯著減少客戶的 IT 相關碳足跡。

### 1.1.9 The Google Cloud Adoption Framework

So how can organizations approach their cloud journey?
那麼，組織應如何開始他們的雲端旅程呢？

Moving to the cloud offers enormous benefits for transforming businesses.
轉向雲端為業務轉型提供了巨大的好處。

Yet there are also risks.
然而，也存在風險。

The challenge is multi-dimensional, with far-reaching implications for the solutions that will run in the cloud and also for the technologies that support them.
這是一個多維挑戰，對於將在雲中運行的解決方案以及支持這些解決方案的技術都有深遠的影響。

The people who must implement them and the processes that govern them.
實施它們的人員以及管理它們的流程。

The rubric of people, process, and technology is a familiar one.
人員、流程和技術的標準是一個熟悉的概念。

It forms the basis of the Google Cloud Adoption Framework, which was created to support customers on their cloud journey.
它構成了 Google 雲採用框架的基礎，該框架是為支持客戶的雲端旅程而創建的。

The value of the Google Cloud Adoption Framework is that it serves as a map to help organizations adopt the cloud quickly and effectively by creating a comprehensive action plan for accelerating cloud adoption.
Google 雲採用框架的價值在於它充當了一個地圖，通過創建一個加速雲採用的綜合行動計劃，幫助組織快速有效地採用雲。

It does this by structuring and aligning short-term tactical, mid-term, strategic, and long-term transformational business objectives.
它通過結構化和對齊短期戰術、中期戰略和長期轉型的業務目標來實現這一點。

It provides a solid assessment of where an organization is in its cloud journey and actionable programs that get it to where it wants to be.
它提供了對組織在其雲端旅程中所處位置的堅實評估，以及使其達到目標的可操作計劃。

A cloud maturity assessment helps to establish where an organization is currently regarding the cloud adoption themes recognized by Google Cloud.
雲成熟度評估有助於確定組織當前在 Google 雲認可的雲採用主題方面所處的位置。

It can quickly reveal any areas where an organization might be weaker or underinvested.
它可以快速揭示組織可能較弱或投資不足的任何領域。

This is especially powerful if an organization was previously unaware of this lack of maturity.
如果組織之前未意識到這一成熟度的缺乏，這尤其強大。

The Google Cloud adoption framework is more than just a model.
Google 雲採用框架不僅僅是一個模型。

It's also a map to real, tangible tasks that organizations need to adopt the cloud.
它還是一個地圖，指引組織需要採取的真實、具體的任務來採用雲。

After cloud maturity has been assessed and actions have been recommended, it's easy to scope and structure a cloud adoption program using the framework.
在評估了雲成熟度並提出行動建議後，使用該框架很容易確定和構建雲採用計劃。

### 1.1.10 Cloud Transformation Summary

This brings us to the end of the first section of the Digital Transformation with Google Cloud course.
這就帶我們結束了《利用 Google Cloud 進行數位轉型》課程的第一部分。

Let's do a quick review of how cloud technology is transforming businesses.
讓我們快速回顧一下雲技術如何改變業務。

Digital transformation is more than lifting and shifting old IT infrastructure to the cloud for cost saving and convenience.
數位轉型不僅僅是為了節省成本和方便而將舊的 IT 基礎設施搬到雲端。

As we look ahead, reinventing the future means changing not only where business is done, but how it is done.
展望未來，重塑未來意味著改變的不僅是業務的地點，還有業務的執行方式。

It requires maximizing the benefits of the cloud and building an environment that lets every person, process and technology bring the highest level of innovation to the business.
這需要最大化雲的優勢，並構建一個使每個人、流程和技術能夠為業務帶來最高創新水平的環境。

We already see tremendous success with leading organizations that embrace the transformation cloud, move their businesses well beyond infrastructure, and rapidly migrate toward the next era of their cloud evolution.
我們已經看到，領先的組織擁抱轉型雲，在超越基礎設施的業務中取得了巨大的成功，並迅速邁向其雲演進的下一個時代。

## 1.2 Fundamental Cloud Concepts 雲的基本概念

### 1.2.1 Introduction

To understand the impact that the cloud can have on a business, it’s important to first recognize some of the fundamental cloud concepts.
要了解雲對業務的影響，首先需要認識到一些基本的雲概念。
By the end of this section, you’ll be able to: Describe the benefits of moving to cloud infrastructure through customer business use cases.
在本節結束時，您將能夠：通過客戶業務用例描述轉向雲基礎設施的好處。
Explain how moving to the cloud shifts an organization's spending from capital expenditure to operational expenditure, and how that affects their total cost of ownership.
解釋轉向雲端如何將組織的支出從資本支出轉變為運營支出，以及這如何影響其總擁有成本。
Identify when private, hybrid, or multicloud infrastructures best apply to different business use cases.
確定私有雲、混合雲或多雲基礎設施何時最適用於不同的業務用例。
Define basic network infrastructure terminology.
定義基本的網絡基礎設施術語。
And explain how Google Cloud supports digital transformation with global infrastructure and data centers connected by a fast, reliable network.
解釋 Google Cloud 如何通過全球基礎設施和由快速可靠的網絡連接的數據中心支持數位轉型。
Cloud adoption has made a positive impact on some of the world’s leading companies across various industries.
雲採用對全球各行各業的一些領先公司產生了積極影響。
Let’s start with an example of how the cloud provided flexibility and improved performance for the Canadian food and pharmacy leader Loblaw.
讓我們從一個例子開始，說明雲如何為加拿大食品和藥品領導者 Loblaw 提供靈活性和改進性能。
Loblaw is Canada’s largest retailer, with nearly 2,500 corporate, franchised, and associate-owned locations and nearly 200,000 full- and part-time employees.
Loblaw 是加拿大最大的零售商，擁有近 2,500 個公司、特許經營和聯營店鋪，以及近 20 萬名全職和兼職員工。
The Vice President of Technology at Loblaw explained: "We want our tech talent focused on creating better experiences for our customers, not maintaining infrastructure."
Loblaw 的技術副總裁解釋說：“我們希望我們的技術人才專注於為客戶創造更好的體驗，而不是維護基礎設施。”
Loblaw took a lift-and-shift approach to accelerate the initial migration to Google Cloud.
Loblaw 採取了升舉和轉移的方法，加速了初始向 Google Cloud 的遷移。
This means they focused on moving their existing virtual machines on-premises to Compute Engine instances in the cloud without needing to redesign them.
這意味著他們專注於將現有的虛擬機從本地遷移到雲中的 Compute Engine 實例，而無需重新設計它們。
However, they designed the cloud architecture to be easily converted to using Google Kubernetes Engine for automated deployment and scaling later.
然而，他們設計的雲架構可以輕鬆轉換為使用 Google Kubernetes Engine 進行自動部署和擴展。
This shows how an open cloud can grow with an organization’s needs.
這表明開放雲如何隨著組織需求的變化而增長。
With a more responsive ecommerce site and the ability to handle more traffic without affecting the customer experience, Loblaw could run marketing promotions and generate additional revenue.
通過更響應迅速的電子商務網站以及在不影響客戶體驗的情況下處理更多流量的能力，Loblaw 可以進行營銷促銷並創造額外收入。
With these improvements, they expect to reclaim 50% of their Site Reliability Engineers’ time to focus on innovation.
通過這些改進，他們預計可以回收 50%的網站可靠性工程師的時間來專注於創新。
Now let’s shift our focus to another example, this time on how the cloud provided scalability and cost reduction.
現在讓我們將重點轉移到另一個例子，這次是雲如何提供可擴展性和降低成本。
HSBC is one of the world’s largest banking and financial services organizations, serving more than 40 million global customers from offices in 64 countries and territories.
匯豐銀行是全球最大的銀行和金融服務機構之一，在 64 個國家和地區的辦事處為超過 4000 萬全球客戶提供服務。
Committed to a cloud-first strategy, in January 2021, HSBC embarked on an ambitious project to enhance and future-proof their risk management on the cloud.
匯豐銀行致力於雲優先戰略，於 2021 年 1 月開始了一個雄心勃勃的項目，以增強和未來保障他們的雲端風險管理。
Their previous on-premises system was not capable of meeting future regulatory and business demands.
他們之前的本地系統無法滿足未來的監管和業務需求。
HSBC built a cloud-native risk management solution that boosts calculation speed to be ten times faster while lowering costs.
匯豐銀行構建了一個雲原生的風險管理解決方案，將計算速度提高了十倍，同時降低了成本。
This equated to three billion calculations per second.
這相當於每秒 30 億次計算。
The power of a data cloud is that it has almost unlimited resources to process large volumes of data and reduce time to insights.
數據雲的強大之處在於它擁有幾乎無限的資源來處理大量數據並縮短獲取見解的時間。
A Global Head of Traded Risk Technology at HSBC explains, "We knew that a cloud-native solution gave us the ability to scale and run at a reduced cost. We did a proof of concept using Google Cloud, and we quickly realized that this could be very successful."
匯豐銀行的全球交易風險技術負責人解釋說："我們知道，雲原生解決方案使我們能夠擴展並以更低的成本運行。我們使用 Google Cloud 進行了概念驗證，很快就意識到這可能非常成功。"
HSBC built a cost-effective platform that is faster and more efficient while meeting their regulatory and compliance requirements.
匯豐銀行構建了一個成本效益高的平台，既更快、更高效，同時滿足其監管和合規要求。
And in a final example, let’s look at how the cloud has brought agility and valuable insights, while maintaining trust, to an organization.
最後一個例子，讓我們看看雲如何在保持信任的同時為一個組織帶來敏捷性和有價值的見解。
The American Cancer Society is a community-based voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem.
美國癌症協會是一個基於社區的志願健康組織，致力於消除癌症這一重大健康問題。
Their mission is to free the world from cancer by funding and conducting research, sharing expert information, supporting patients, and spreading the word about prevention.
他們的使命是通過資助和進行研究、分享專家信息、支持患者並傳播預防知識來解救世界脫離癌症。
Among women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer.
在女性中，乳腺癌是最常見的癌症類型。
Yet, if detected early, it’s also one of the most survivable cancers.
然而，如果及早發現，它也是最容易存活的癌症之一。
Mia M. Gaudet, PhD, is the Scientific Director of Epidemiology Research at the American Cancer Society.
Mia M. Gaudet 博士是美國癌症協會流行病學研究的科學主任。
Through her research, she’s obtained over 1,700 high-resolution tissue images from participants diagnosed with breast cancer.
通過她的研究，她獲得了超過 1,700 張來自被診斷患有乳腺癌的參與者的高分辨率組織圖像。
This valuable data could help them discover factors that could lead to a cancer diagnosis and improve survival rates.
這些寶貴數據可以幫助他們發現可能導致癌症診斷的因素並提高生存率。
The challenge was to identify novel patterns in digital images of breast cancer tissues to potentially improve patient outcomes.
挑戰在於識別乳腺癌組織數字圖像中的新模式，以潛在地改善患者結果。
Their research group partnered with Slalom, a Google Cloud Premier Partner, and sought to combine machine learning–powered insights with cloud computing performance to improve timeliness and accuracy.
他們的研究小組與 Google Cloud 首選合作夥伴 Slalom 合作，尋求結合機器學習驅動的見解和雲計算性能來提高及時性和準確性。
By building a machine learning pipeline using Google Cloud AI Platform, now called Vertex AI, they trained models for AI image analysis of tissue scans to find cancer indicators.
通過使用 Google Cloud AI 平台（現在稱為 Vertex AI）構建機器學習管道，他們訓練了 AI 圖像分析模型來檢測組織掃描中的癌症指標。
The team achieved 12 times faster image analysis with enhanced quality and accuracy by removing human limitations.
該團隊通過消除人為限制，實現了 12 倍更快的圖像分析，並提高了質量和準確性。
Dr. Gaudet said, "The ability to perform image analysis by using deep learning for epidemiologic breast cancer studies opens a new frontier of research, and Google Cloud makes it easier. We're excited about what we'll find."
Gaudet 博士說："利用深度學習進行流行病學乳腺癌研究的圖像分析能力開創了一個新的研究前沿，Google Cloud 使這一切變得更容易。我們對我們將發現的東西感到興奮。"
The American Cancer Society is now equipped with processes and a cloud infrastructure that will be reusable on similar projects, providing a foundation for future work.
美國癌症協會現在擁有可在類似項目中重用的流程和雲基礎設施，為未來的工作提供了基礎。

### 1.2.2 Total cost of ownership(TCO)

Organizations often perform a cloud total cost of ownership (or TCO) analysis when they are considering moving to the cloud.
組織在考慮轉向雲端時，通常會進行雲總擁有成本（TCO）分析。

This analysis aims to weigh the cost of cloud adoption against the cost of running their current on-premises systems.
這一分析旨在權衡雲採用成本與運行當前本地系統的成本。

For on-premises, TCO is associated with assessing the cost of static resources throughout their lifetime.
對於本地系統，TCO 與評估靜態資源在其整個生命周期中的成本相關。

However, due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, predicting future costs can be challenging.
然而，由於雲的動態特性，預測未來成本可能具有挑戰性。

A common mistake that organizations make when attempting to calculate cloud TCO is to directly compare the running costs of the cloud against their on-premises system.
組織在嘗試計算雲 TCO 時常犯的一個錯誤是直接比較雲的運行成本與本地系統的運行成本。

These costs are not equivalent.
這些成本並不等同。

The cost of on-premises infrastructure is dominated by the initial purchase of hardware and software, but cloud computing costs are based on monthly subscriptions or pay-per-use models.
本地基礎設施的成本主要由硬件和軟件的初始購買費用組成，而雲計算成本則基於月度訂閱或按使用量付費的模式。

It's also important to consider all the operational costs of running your own data center, such as power, cooling, maintenance, and other support services.
還需要考慮運營自有數據中心的所有運營成本，如電力、冷卻、維護和其他支持服務。

A data center is a building or facility that houses a large amount of IT infrastructure, computing, and storage resources in one place.
數據中心是一個建築或設施，集中安置大量的 IT 基礎設施、計算和存儲資源。

Finally, intangible costs, such as the opportunity cost of not migrating to cloud and the missed benefits, should be considered.
最後，應考慮無形成本，例如未遷移到雲端的機會成本和錯失的利益。

### 1.2.3 Capital expenditures (CapEx) versus operating expenses (OpEx)

One area where cloud differs from traditional IT is in how managing costs changes when you move to the cloud.
雲與傳統 IT 不同的一個方面是在轉向雲時如何改變成本管理。

With organizations moving from on-premises infrastructure to on-demand cloud services, there’s a major shift in spending from capital expenditures to operating expenses.
隨著組織從本地基礎設施轉向按需雲服務，支出從資本支出轉向運營費用發生了重大變化。

But what’s the difference between these two?
但這兩者之間有什麼區別呢？

Capital expenditures, or CapEx, are upfront business expenses put toward fixed assets.
資本支出，或稱 CapEx，是為固定資產支付的前期業務費用。

Organizations buy these items once, and they benefit their business for many years.
組織一次性購買這些物品，它們將使業務受益多年。

For example, in IT, these expenditures might mean buying hardware like servers, printers, or cooling systems.
例如，在 IT 領域，這些支出可能意味著購買硬件，如服務器、打印機或冷卻系統。

Maintaining these assets is also considered CapEx because it extends their lifetime and usefulness.
維護這些資產也被視為 CapEx，因為它延長了它們的壽命和效用。

Small businesses can find CapEx spending challenging because large one-time purchases are often high cost.
小型企業可能會發現 CapEx 支出具有挑戰性，因為一次性大額購買通常成本很高。

The more money you put toward CapEx means less free cash flow for the rest of the business.
投向資本支出的資金越多，企業其餘部分的自由現金流就越少。

And then there are operating expenses, or OpEx, which are recurring costs for a more immediate benefit.
還有運營費用，即 OpEx，這是為了更直接的利益而產生的經常性費用。

This represents the day-to-day expenses to run a business.
這代表了運營業務的日常費用。

In IT, these expenses might be yearly services like website hosting or domain registrations, or the subscription fee for cloud services.
在 IT 領域，這些費用可能是網站託管或域名註冊等年度服務，或者是雲服務的訂閱費用。

OpEx covers the spending on pay-as-you-go items, but are not considered major long-term investments like CapEx items.
OpEx 涵蓋按需付費項目的支出，但不被認為是像 CapEx 項目那樣的重大長期投資。

Understanding the difference between CapEx and OpEx is helpful in recognizing how costs differ between on-premises and the public cloud.
了解 CapEx 和 OpEx 之間的區別有助於認識到本地和公共雲之間成本的差異。

In the on-premises CapEx model, cost management and budgeting are a one-time operational process completed annually.
在本地 CapEx 模型中，成本管理和預算是一個每年完成一次的運營過程。

Data centers require a huge CapEx investment up front as organizations purchase space, equipment, and software and hire a workforce to run and maintain everything.
數據中心需要前期大量的 CapEx 投資，因為組織需要購買空間、設備和軟件，並僱用員工來運行和維護所有設施。

Forecasting is based on a metric such as historic growth to determine the needs for the next month, quarter, year, or even multiple years.
預測是基於歷史增長等指標來確定下個月、季度、年度甚至多年的需求。

Moving to cloud’s on-demand OpEx model enables organizations to pay only for what they use and only when they use it.
轉向雲的按需 OpEx 模型使組織只需為其使用的東西支付費用，並且只在使用時支付費用。

Budgeting is no longer a one-time operational process completed annually.
預算不再是每年完成一次的運營過程。

Instead, spending must be monitored and controlled on an ongoing basis due to the dynamic nature of cloud use within organizations.
相反，由於雲在組織內部使用的動態特性，支出必須持續監控和控制。

How infrastructure is procured has radically changed, too.
基礎設施的採購方式也發生了根本性的變化。

In a more decentralized cloud world, any employee can create resources in seconds on infrastructure owned and managed by a cloud provider.
在更去中心化的雲世界中，任何員工都可以在雲提供商擁有和管理的基礎設施上在幾秒鐘內創建資源。

Organizations save on power, cooling, and floor space; they save on management because they don’t have to install, operate, upgrade, and troubleshoot it themselves.
組織在電力、冷卻和佔地空間上節省成本；他們在管理上節省成本，因為他們不必自己安裝、運行、升級和排除故障。

And they're not depreciating the equipment—the cloud provider is.
而且他們不會對設備進行折舊——雲提供商會這樣做。

Cloud gives organizations the ability to start small and grow organically instead of having to guess at what is needed next week, next month, and next year.
雲使組織能夠從小開始並有機增長，而不必猜測下周、下月和明年需要什麼。

Costs match actual usage and are now operational expenses.
成本與實際使用情況相匹配，現在是運營費用。

### 1.2.4 Private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud strategies

It's not always possible, or necessary, for an organization to rely solely on the cloud.
組織並不總是可能或必要完全依賴雲端。

For example, requirements might call for on-premises infrastructure to work with public cloud services provided by companies, like Google Cloud.
例如，需求可能要求本地基礎設施與公司提供的公共雲服務（如 Google Cloud）協同工作。

With the availability of different cloud options and configurations, it’s important to understand what each means.
隨著不同雲選項和配置的可用，了解每個選項的含義很重要。

Let’s explore the definitions of private, hybrid, and multi-cloud, and when an organization might choose each approach.
讓我們探討私有雲、混合雲和多雲的定義，以及組織可能選擇每種方法的情況。

Let’s begin with private cloud, which is when an organization has virtualized servers in its own data centers, or those of a private cloud provider, to create its own private dedicated environment.
我們從私有雲開始，這是指組織在其自己的數據中心或私有雲提供商的數據中心中擁有虛擬化服務器，以創建其自己的私有專用環境。

On-premises servers are also often referred to as private clouds, but generally the distinction can be made that on-premises software runs in a local environment, whereas a private cloud is accessed through the internet.
本地服務器也經常被稱為私有雲，但通常可以區分本地軟件在本地環境中運行，而私有雲是通過互聯網訪問的。

Private cloud computing gives an organization many of the benefits of a public cloud — including self-service, scalability, and elasticity — with more customization available than from dedicated on-premises infrastructure.
私有雲計算為組織提供了許多公共雲的好處——包括自助服務、可擴展性和彈性——並且比專用的本地基礎設施提供更多的定制選項。

This approach is often used when an organization has already made significant infrastructure investments, or if, for regulatory reasons, data must be kept on-premises.
這種方法通常在組織已經進行了大量基礎設施投資，或者出於監管原因，數據必須保存在本地時使用。

In contrast, a hybrid cloud is one in which applications are running in a combination of different environments.
相比之下，混合雲是指應用程序在不同環境的組合中運行。

The most common example is combining a private and public cloud environment, like an on-premises data center, and a public cloud computing environment like Google Cloud.
最常見的例子是結合私有和公共雲環境，例如本地數據中心和公共雲計算環境，如 Google Cloud。

Finally, there’s multicloud, which describes architectures that combine at least two public cloud providers, such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or others.
最後是多雲，這是指結合至少兩個公共雲提供商的架構，如 Google Cloud、Amazon Web Services、Microsoft Azure 或其他。

An organization might choose multicloud if they want to take advantage of the key strengths of different public cloud providers.
如果組織希望利用不同公共雲提供商的主要優勢，他們可能會選擇多雲。

Organizations may also operate a combination of on-premises and multiple public cloud environments, effectively being both hybrid and multicloud simultaneously.
組織也可能運營本地和多個公共雲環境的組合，實際上同時是混合雲和多雲。

A hybrid cloud approach is one of the most common infrastructure setups today because organizations can continue to use their on-premises servers while also taking advantage of public cloud.
混合雲方法是當今最常見的基礎設施設置之一，因為組織可以繼續使用其本地服務器，同時利用公共雲的優勢。

According to Gartner, 81% of organizations are working with two or more public cloud providers.
根據 Gartner 的數據，81%的組織正在與兩個或更多的公共雲提供商合作。

Additionally, a Flexera state of the cloud report showed 93% of enterprises have a multicloud strategy.
此外，Flexera 的雲狀態報告顯示，93%的企業有多雲策略。

So, what is a hybrid or multicloud strategy used for?
那麼，混合雲或多雲策略是用來做什麼的呢？

Let's explore some different business requirements, drivers, and use cases that lead an organization to choose this kind of approach.
讓我們探討一些不同的業務需求、驅動因素和用例，這些因素導致組織選擇這種方法。

**Access to the latest technologies**
**獲取最新技術**

Running workloads in multiple clouds empowers organizations to leverage the latest innovations and capabilities from each cloud provider, thus taking a best-in-class approach to cloud features and obtaining the scale, security, and agility to innovate fast.
在多個雲中運行工作負載使組織能夠利用每個雲提供商的最新創新和功能，從而採用最佳的雲功能方法，並獲得快速創新的規模、安全性和敏捷性。

Cloud can help organizations build out capabilities, such as advanced analytics services, that might be difficult, or impossible, to implement in existing environments.
雲可以幫助組織建立能力，例如高級分析服務，這些能力在現有環境中可能難以或無法實現。

**Modernize at the right pace**
**以合適的速度現代化**

With a hybrid cloud, organizations can migrate applications to the cloud at the pace that makes sense for their business and transform their technical infrastructure over time.
通過混合雲，組織可以以適合其業務的速度將應用程序遷移到雲端，並隨著時間的推移轉型其技術基礎設施。

**Improved return on investment**
**提高投資回報率**

By adding a public cloud provider to their existing on-premises infrastructure, organizations can expand their cloud computing capacity without increasing their data center expenses.
通過在現有本地基礎設施中添加公共雲提供商，組織可以擴展其雲計算能力，而不增加其數據中心費用。

This can help reduce CapEx or general IT spending, and improve transparency regarding costs and resource consumption.
這有助於減少 CapEx 或一般 IT 支出，並提高成本和資源消耗的透明度。

**Flexibility through choice of tools**
**通過工具選擇實現靈活性**

Hybrid and multi-cloud strategies have advantages for organizations as a whole, but specifically benefit development teams that are working on different projects and tackling unique challenges across different lines of business.
混合雲和多雲策略對組織整體有優勢，但特別有利於在不同項目上工作並應對不同業務線獨特挑戰的開發團隊。

A wider choice of tools and developer talent can be applied to a particular business problem, which means responding better to changing market demands.
更廣泛的工具和開發人才選擇可以應用於特定的業務問題，這意味著更好地響應不斷變化的市場需求。

It also avoids vendor lock-in concerns.
這也避免了供應商鎖定問題。

**Improve reliability and resiliency**
**提高可靠性和韌性**

Organizations can distribute core workloads across multiple cloud and on-premises infrastructures to reduce downtime and concerns about over-dependence on a single source of failure.
組織可以將核心工作負載分佈在多個雲和本地基礎設施中，以減少停機時間和對單一故障源過度依賴的擔憂。

This approach can improve the quality and availability of a service.
這種方法可以提高服務的質量和可用性。

**Maintain regulatory compliance**
**維持合規性**

Many industries have rules from governmental or regulatory bodies regarding where their app can operate.
許多行業有政府或監管機構關於其應用程序可以運行的位置的規定。

Adopting a hybrid solution is an effective way for an organization to ensure compliance with regional data governance, residency, or digital sovereignty requirements.
採用混合解決方案是組織確保符合地區數據治理、駐留或數字主權要求的有效方法。

**Running apps on-premises**
**在本地運行應用程序**

Organizations may have regulated applications that must remain on-premises or mainframe systems that are difficult to move to the cloud.
組織可能有必須保留在本地的受監管應用程序或難以遷移到雲端的大型機系統。

A hybrid approach provides the freedom to innovate while still meeting regulatory requirements.
混合方法提供了創新自由，同時滿足監管要求。

**Running apps at remote edge locations**
**在遠程邊緣位置運行應用程序**

Organizations in industries that run distributed apps at remote locations, such as kiosks in retail or networks in telecom, can benefit from hybrid cloud.
在遠程位置運行分佈式應用程序的行業中的組織，例如零售中的自助服務終端或電信中的網絡，可以從混合雲中受益。

These apps often require improved performance and low latency, and a hybrid approach lets them run select apps at the network edge.
這些應用程序通常需要提高性能和低延遲，混合方法使它們能夠在網絡邊緣運行選定的應用程序。

### 1.2.5 How a network supports digital transformation

Digital transformation has increased the importance of the network.
數位轉型提高了網絡的重要性。

The ability to connect customers, employees, cloud applications, and devices enables modern organizations to succeed.
連接客戶、員工、雲應用程序和設備的能力使現代組織能夠成功。

With every innovation, the underlying apps and services rely on the network to communicate and connect.
隨著每一次創新，底層應用程序和服務依賴於網絡進行通信和連接。

But how does a reliable networking architecture support a digital transformation strategy?
但是，可靠的網絡架構如何支持數位轉型戰略呢？

A fast, reliable, and low-latency global network ensures exceptional user experience and high performance.
快速、可靠和低延遲的全球網絡確保了卓越的用戶體驗和高性能。

It also makes it easier to communicate and manage data globally.
它還使全球通信和數據管理變得更容易。

With ever more distributed workforces and online businesses, having virtual network services that can easily scale without adding hardware ensures that organizations can adapt.
隨著越來越多的分佈式勞動力和在線業務，擁有可以輕鬆擴展的虛擬網絡服務而無需添加硬件，確保了組織的適應性。

So, how does a network operate?
那麼，網絡是如何運作的呢？

Let's start with the foundation of the modern internet: fiber-optic networks.
讓我們從現代互聯網的基礎——光纖網絡開始。

Fiber-optic cables contain one or more optical fibers, which are thin strands made of glass or plastic.
光纖電纜包含一根或多根光纖，這些光纖是由玻璃或塑料製成的細線。

These fibers are used to transmit data as pulses of light over long distances.
這些光纖用於以光脈衝的形式在長距離內傳輸數據。

Subsea fiber-optic cables carry 99% of international network traffic, yet we barely notice they exist.
海底光纖電纜承載著 99%的國際網絡流量，但我們幾乎沒有注意到它們的存在。

The first subsea cable was deployed in 1858 for telegraph messages between Europe and North America.
第一條海底電纜於 1858 年部署，用於歐洲和北美之間的電報信息傳輸。

A message took over 17 hours to deliver, at 2 minutes and 5 seconds per letter by Morse code.
一條信息需要超過 17 小時傳送，每個字母用摩爾斯電碼需要 2 分鐘 5 秒。

Today, a single cable can deliver a whopping 340 Terabits per second.
今天，一條電纜可以傳輸高達 340 太比特每秒的數據。

That's more than 25 million times faster than the average home internet connection!
這比家庭互聯網連接速度快超過 2500 萬倍！

Every shared video, sent email, and downloaded app depends on data traffic that moves through international network infrastructure.
每個共享視頻、發送的電子郵件和下載的應用程序都依賴於通過國際網絡基礎設施傳輸的數據流量。

But how is this content available to people within milliseconds?
但是，這些內容如何在毫秒內提供給人們？

A rich ecosystem of companies and local providers build a global infrastructure that provides businesses and people around the world with the best possible internet experience.
公司和本地提供商構建了一個豐富的生態系統，提供全球基礎設施，為全球的企業和人們提供最佳的互聯網體驗。

These include companies like internet service providers (or ISPs).
這些包括互聯網服務提供商（或稱 ISP）等公司。

ISPs provide access to the internet to both personal and business customers, handling the traffic between the customer and the internet as a whole.
ISP 為個人和企業客戶提供互聯網接入，處理客戶與整個互聯網之間的流量。

Some examples of ISPs include Verizon, Vodafone, and Softbank.
ISP 的一些例子包括 Verizon、Vodafone 和 Softbank。

The infrastructure that makes Google’s global reach possible is our network of fiber-optic cables that run on both land and sea.
使 Google 能夠實現全球覆蓋的基礎設施是我們在陸地和海洋上運行的光纖電纜網絡。

This network connects our data centers and points of presence like highways connect major cities.
這個網絡連接我們的數據中心和接入點，就像高速公路連接主要城市一樣。

Google owns and operates data centers all over the world.
Google 在全球擁有並運營數據中心。

In these Google data centers, products like Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Google Cloud are run for people and organizations around the world, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
在這些 Google 數據中心，Search、Gmail、YouTube 和 Google Cloud 等產品每天 24 小時，每周 7 天為全球的人們和組織運行。

Within this vast global network, how do all the different parts recognize and communicate with each other?
在這個龐大的全球網絡中，所有不同的部分如何識別和通信？

There are protocols that make it work.
有一些協議使其運作。

Let's start with an IP address.
讓我們從 IP 地址開始。

The IP stands for Internet Protocol, and this address is a series of numbers that can identify a network or the location of a particular device on a network.
IP 代表互聯網協議，這個地址是一系列數字，可以識別網絡或網絡上特定設備的位置。

A domain name is an easy-to-remember name that maps directly to an IP address or set of IP addresses on the internet.
域名是一個易於記住的名稱，直接映射到互聯網上的 IP 地址或一組 IP 地址。

It’s the unique name that appears after the @ sign in email addresses and after www. in web addresses.
它是電子郵件地址中@符號後面出現的唯一名稱，也是網址中 www.後面出現的名稱。

For instance, the domain name example.com might translate to the IP address 192.168.200.8.
例如，域名 example.com 可能會轉換為 IP 地址 192.168.200.8。

Other examples of domain names are google.com and youtube.com.
其他域名的例子包括 google.com 和 youtube.com。

And then there’s a Domain Name System, or DNS.
然後是域名系統，或稱 DNS。

A DNS server stores a database of domain names mapped to IP addresses that can be queried and used by computers to communicate with each other.
DNS 服務器存儲域名映射到 IP 地址的數據庫，計算機可以查詢並使用這些數據庫進行通信。

This system is like the phone book of the web.
這個系統就像互聯網的電話簿。

Every time you visit a website, your computer performs a DNS lookup.
每當您訪問一個網站時，您的計算機都會進行 DNS 查找。

A phone book translates a name like "Acme Pizza" into the correct phone number to call; similarly, the DNS translates a web address like "www.google.com" into the IP address of the computer hosting that site.
電話簿將“Acme Pizza”這樣的名稱翻譯成正確的電話號碼；同樣，DNS 將“www.google.com”這樣的網址翻譯成託管該站點的計算機的IP地址。

In this case, it’s the Google homepage.
在這種情況下，它是 Google 首頁。

### 1.2.6 Network performance: Bandwidth and latency

Now that you’ve been introduced to some of the fundamentals of networking, let’s explore how networks perform and are measured.
現在您已經了解了一些網絡的基本知識，讓我們來探討一下網絡的性能和測量方法。

Two important terms in networking are bandwidth and latency.
網絡中的兩個重要術語是帶寬和延遲。

Let’s define them both.
讓我們來定義它們。

**Bandwidth** is a measure of how much data a network can transfer in a given amount of time.
帶寬是衡量網絡在給定時間內可以傳輸多少數據的指標。

This rate of data transfer is typically measured in terms of “megabits per second” (or Mbps) or “gigabits per second” (or Gbps).
這個數據傳輸速率通常以“每秒兆位”（Mbps）或“每秒吉位”（Gbps）來衡量。

Generally speaking, a higher bandwidth allows a computer to download information from the internet more quickly.
一般來說，更高的帶寬允許計算機更快地從互聯網下載信息。

One way to think of bandwidth is to picture water flowing through a pipe.
帶寬的一種理解方式是將其比作水流過管道。

The bandwidth would be the volume of water a pipe can handle flowing through per second.
帶寬相當於管道每秒可以處理的水量。

A wider pipe can handle more water.
管道越寬，可以處理的水量越多。

An internet service provider may provide a home internet connection with 100 MegaBits per second to over 1 GigaBit per second; a data center may have bandwidth from 10 to 100 GigaBits per second!
互聯網服務提供商可能會提供每秒 100 兆位到每秒超過 1 吉位的家庭互聯網連接；數據中心的帶寬可能從每秒 10 吉位到每秒 100 吉位不等！

Having a high bandwidth is useful when sending a large amount of data per second, such as streaming high-definition video, but it’s not the only important measure of network performance.
高帶寬在每秒發送大量數據（如流媒體高清視頻）時很有用，但這不是衡量網絡性能的唯一重要指標。

For example, for users playing real-time multiplayer games online, latency will matter much more.
例如，對於在線玩實時多人遊戲的用戶來說，延遲將更加重要。

**Network latency** is the amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another.
網絡延遲是數據從一個點傳輸到另一個點所需的時間。

Often measured in milliseconds, latency, sometimes called lag, describes delays in communication over a network.
延遲通常以毫秒為單位，有時被稱為延遲，描述的是網絡通信中的延遲。

Going back to our flowing water analogy, latency is the delay from the moment the water pipe is opened until water starts flowing through.
回到我們的流水類比，延遲是指從水管打開到水開始流過的延遲時間。

Ideally, latency should be as close to zero as possible.
理想情況下，延遲應盡可能接近於零。

However, because it’s a result of the physical distance that data must travel – through wires, fiber optics, routers, and more – to reach its destination, each “hop” along the way adds a small amount of latency to the communication.
然而，由於數據必須通過電線、光纖、路由器等傳輸到達目的地的物理距離，每一次“跳躍”都會在通信中增加少量延遲。

No matter how much data you can send and receive at once, it can only travel as fast as network latency allows.
無論您一次可以發送和接收多少數據，它只能按照網絡延遲允許的速度進行傳輸。

Imagine an image file took just 10 milliseconds to download with a high-bandwidth connection, but a user had to wait 100 milliseconds before receiving the first byte of data.
想象一下，一個圖像文件使用高帶寬連接只需 10 毫秒即可下載，但用戶必須等待 100 毫秒才能收到第一個字節的數據。

In this case, the latency, or how much time it took for data packets to travel from one point to another in the network, accounted for most of the time.
在這種情況下，延遲或數據包在網絡中從一點傳輸到另一點所需的時間佔用了大部分時間。

Cloud computing and mobile technologies have made it easier for developers to reach global audiences, but high latency can drag down an application's performance.
雲計算和移動技術使開發者更容易接觸到全球受眾，但高延遲可能會拖慢應用程序的性能。

Websites run slower for some users depending on their physical location, even if both the user and the server have excellent bandwidth.
網站對某些用戶運行得較慢，這取決於他們的物理位置，即使用戶和服務器都擁有優秀的帶寬。

So the farther a user is from a server, or the more fragmented the network is, the bigger the latency.
因此，用戶離服務器越遠，或網絡越分散，延遲就越大。

**Reducing latency is essential to reaching users faster.**
**減少延遲對於更快地到達用戶至關重要。**

### 1.2.7 Google Cloud regions and zones

Google has invested billions of dollars over the years to build its network, which is one of the largest networks of its kind on Earth.
多年來，Google 投入了數十億美元來建設其網絡，這是地球上同類網絡中最大的網絡之一。

It’s designed to give customers the highest possible throughput and lowest possible latencies for their applications.
其設計目的是為客戶的應用程序提供最高的吞吐量和最低的延遲。

Google Cloud’s infrastructure is based in five major geographic locations.
Google Cloud 的基礎設施基於五個主要地理位置。

Having multiple service locations is important because choosing where to locate applications affects qualities like availability, durability, and latency, the latter of which measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to its destination.
擁有多個服務位置很重要，因為選擇應用程序的所在地點會影響可用性、持久性和延遲等質量，後者測量的是信息包從源到目的地所需的時間。

Each of these locations is divided into several different regions and zones.
每個位置被劃分為若干不同的區域和區。

Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.
區域代表獨立的地理區域，由區組成。

For example, London, or europe-west2, is a region that currently comprises three different zones.
例如，倫敦或 europe-west2 是一個區域，目前包括三個不同的區。

A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.
區是 Google Cloud 資源部署的區域。

For example, if you launch a virtual machine using Compute Engine, it will run in the zone that you specify to ensure resource redundancy.
例如，如果您使用 Compute Engine 啟動虛擬機，它將在您指定的區運行，以確保資源冗餘。

You can run resources in different regions.
您可以在不同區域運行資源。

This is useful for bringing applications closer to users around the world, and also for protection in case there are issues with an entire region, such as a natural disaster.
這對於將應用程序更接近全球用戶很有用，並且在整個區域（如自然災害）出現問題時提供保護。

Some of Google Cloud’s services support placing resources in what we call a multi-region.
Google Cloud 的一些服務支持將資源放置在我們稱之為多區域的地方。

For example, Cloud Storage lets you place data within the Europe multi-region.
例如，Cloud Storage 允許您將數據放置在歐洲多區域內。

That means it's stored redundantly in at least two geographic locations, separated by at least 160 kilometers within Europe like London and Belgium.
這意味著它被冗餘存儲在至少兩個地理位置，在歐洲內至少相隔 160 公里，如倫敦和比利時。

You can find the most up-to-date numbers for Google Cloud regions and zones at cloud.google.com/about/locations.
您可以在 cloud.google.com/about/locations 找到 Google Cloud 區域和區的最新數據。

### 1.2.8 Google's edge network

A recommended best practice for organizations is to keep their traffic on Google's private network for most of its journey, using the same network that powers products like Gmail, Google Search, and YouTube. This allows organizations to take advantage of the performance that global infrastructure provides.
建議的最佳做法是讓組織的大部分流量保持在 Google 的私有網絡上，使用與 Gmail、Google 搜索和 YouTube 等產品相同的網絡，讓組織能夠利用全球基礎設施提供的性能優勢。

When a user opens a Google app or Web page, Google responds to that request from an edge network location that will provide the lowest latency.
當用戶打開 Google 應用程序或網頁時，Google 會從提供最低延遲的邊緣網絡位置響應該請求。

Understanding Google's Edge Network and how it maintains caches that store popular content near its users helps organizations choose when to hand off traffic to Google.
了解 Google 的邊緣網絡以及它如何在用戶附近維護存儲熱門內容的緩存，有助於組織選擇何時將流量交給 Google。

A network's edge is defined as a place where a device or an organization's network connects to the Internet.
網絡的邊緣被定義為設備或組織的網絡連接到互聯網的地方。

It's called "the edge" because it's the entry point to the network.
它被稱為“邊緣”，因為它是網絡的入口點。

Google's Edge Network is how we connect with ISPs to get traffic to and from users.
Google 的邊緣網絡是我們如何與 ISP 連接以獲取來自用戶的流量。

It's made up of network infrastructure that organizations can hand off traffic to based on users' needs, performance, and cost.
它由網絡基礎設施組成，組織可以根據用戶需求、性能和成本將流量交給它。

Google aims to deliver its services with high performance, high reliability, and low latency for users.
Google 的目標是為用戶提供高性能、高可靠性和低延遲的服務。

We have invested in network infrastructure that's aligned with this goal and that also allows us to exchange traffic efficiently and cost-effectively with network operators.
我們已經投資了符合這一目標的網絡基礎設施，這也使我們能夠與網絡運營商高效且具有成本效益地交換流量。

This is how network infrastructure supports digital transformation.
這就是網絡基礎設施支持數位轉型的方式。

### 1.2.9 Summary

This brings us to the end of the second section of the Digital Transformation with Google Cloud course.
這使我們完成了 Google Cloud 數位轉型課程的第二部分。

Let's do a quick review of some fundamental cloud concepts.
讓我們快速回顧一些基本的雲概念。

We covered examples of how customers from different industries were able to transform their business through creating new ways of working when moving to the cloud.
我們討論了不同產業的客戶如何通過雲遷移創造新的工作方式來轉型其業務的例子。

Calculating the total cost of ownership differs greatly from the static and long-term procurement on-premises world to the more dynamic and on-demand cloud world.
計算總擁有成本在靜態和長期採購的本地世界與更加動態和按需的雲世界之間有很大不同。

Moving to cloud means shifting spending from a capital expenditure to operational expenses model, enabling organizations to pay only for what they use and only when they use it.
遷移到雲端意味著將支出從資本支出轉變為運營支出模式，使組織只需為其使用的東西支付費用，並且只在使用時支付費用。

We defined private, hybrid, and multi-cloud and described the different business drivers that lead an organization to choose these kinds of approaches.
我們定義了私有雲、混合雲和多雲，並描述了導致組織選擇這些方法的不同業務驅動因素。

And finally, you learned the importance of a fast, reliable, and low-latency global network as a foundation to transformation and exceptional user experience.
最後，您了解了快速、可靠和低延遲的全球網絡作為轉型和卓越用戶體驗基礎的重要性。

## 1.3 Cloud Computing Models and Shared Responsibility

### 1.3.1 Introduction to cloud computing models and shared responsibility

When moving to the cloud, there are decisions to make about how to manage and operate different cloud services.
遷移到雲端時，需要做出關於如何管理和運營不同雲服務的決策。

One of those decisions is around the type of cloud computing service model to use.
其中一個決定是選擇使用哪種類型的雲計算服務模型。

Organizations typically choose service model types based on their specific business requirements.
組織通常根據其具體業務需求選擇服務模型類型。

In this section of the course, you'll explore three main cloud computing service models: IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service; PaaS, or Platform as a Service; and SaaS, or Software as a Service.
在本節課程中，您將探討三種主要的雲計算服務模型：IaaS，即基礎設施即服務；PaaS，即平台即服務；SaaS，即軟件即服務。

Because the levels of responsibility between an organization and their cloud service provider vary depending on which model is used, you'll also examine the shared responsibility model between Google Cloud and our customers.
由於組織與其雲服務提供商之間的責任級別根據使用的模型而有所不同，您還將研究 Google Cloud 與我們的客戶之間的共享責任模型。

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
在本節結束時，您將能夠：

-   Define IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
-   定義 IaaS、PaaS 和 SaaS。

-   Compare and contrast the benefits and tradeoffs of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
-   比較和對比 IaaS、PaaS 和 SaaS 的優點和權衡。

-   Determine which computing model applies to various business scenarios and use cases.
-   確定哪種計算模型適用於各種業務場景和用例。

-   Describe the cloud shared responsibility model.
-   描述雲共享責任模型。

-   And identify which responsibilities are the cloud provider's or the customer's for on-premises and cloud computing models.
-   並確定在本地和雲計算模型中哪些責任屬於雲提供商或客戶。

### 1.3.2 Cloud computing service models

The world of cloud computing has a diverse set of computing service models to choose from, depending on customer requirements.
雲計算世界有多種計算服務模型可供選擇，具體取決於客戶需求。

You might have heard of terms like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
您可能聽說過 IaaS、PaaS 和 SaaS 等術語。

These terms represent the different cloud computing models provided "as a service" by cloud providers.
這些術語代表了雲提供商提供的不同雲計算模型“即服務”。

"As a service" refers to the way IT resources are consumed in these models, and is a key difference between cloud computing and traditional IT.
“即服務”是指在這些模型中消耗 IT 資源的方式，是雲計算與傳統 IT 之間的主要區別。

In traditional IT, an organization consumes resources, such as hardware, software, and development tools, by purchasing, installing, managing, and maintaining them in its own on-premises or self-managed data center.
在傳統 IT 中，組織通過購買、安裝、管理和維護其在本地或自我管理的數據中心中消耗資源，例如硬件、軟件和開發工具。

Organizations are responsible for all of their IT infrastructure when it's completely on-premises.
當完全在本地時，組織對其所有 IT 基礎設施負責。

In cloud computing, the cloud service provider owns, manages, and maintains the resources.
在雲計算中，雲服務提供商擁有、管理和維護資源。

The customer consumes those resources, which are provided on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.
客戶消耗這些資源，這些資源是按訂閱或按需付費提供的。

All you need is an internet connection.
您只需要一個互聯網連接。

Cloud computing allows for a third party to be responsible for some part of the infrastructure.
雲計算允許第三方負責基礎設施的某些部分。

This means that organizations then have more time to focus on their core business.
這意味著組織有更多時間專注於其核心業務。

Coming up, we're going to explore three different cloud computing service models: Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, which provides basic infrastructure services; Platform as a Service, or PaaS, which offers a develop-and-deploy environment to build cloud apps; and Software as a Service, or SaaS, which delivers complete applications as services.
接下來，我們將探討三種不同的雲計算服務模型：基礎設施即服務（IaaS），提供基本的基礎設施服務；平台即服務（PaaS），提供開發和部署環境以構建雲應用程序；以及軟件即服務（SaaS），以服務形式提供完整的應用程序。

Each model offers distinct features and functionalities, and knowing the differences between them helps organizations choose one to best fit their business needs.
每個模型都提供了不同的功能和特性，了解它們之間的區別有助於組織選擇最適合其業務需求的模型。

It’s important to remember that most organizations that use cloud often use a combination of cloud computing models to solve for different needs.
重要的是要記住，大多數使用雲的組織通常會使用多種雲計算模型的組合來解決不同的需求。

You can visualize these cloud computing models in layers.
您可以將這些雲計算模型想象成層次結構。

As you move up the layers from one model to another, each model requires less knowledge and management of the underlying infrastructure.
當您從一個模型移動到另一個模型時，每個模型對底層基礎設施的知識和管理需求越少。

This concept is called abstraction.
這個概念被稱為抽象。

In cloud architecture, as the level of abstraction increases, less is known about the underlying implementation.
在雲架構中，隨著抽象層次的增加，對底層實現的了解越少。

The goal of "abstracting away” infrastructure is to reduce complexity by removing unnecessary information and simplifying operations.
“抽象化”基礎設施的目標是通過消除不必要的信息和簡化操作來減少複雜性。

Think about abstraction in the way that you operate a car.
想想您操作汽車的方式來理解抽象。

When you turn on the ignition, press the brake, put the car into gear, and accelerate, you’re not thinking about how the engine is physically operating under the hood, right?
當您啟動點火裝置、踩剎車、掛檔和加速時，您不會考慮發動機在引擎蓋下是如何運行的，對吧？

That complexity is abstracted away from you, so you can focus on driving safely to your destination.
這些複雜性已經被抽象化，讓您可以專注於安全駕駛到達目的地。

Abstraction is one of the core features of cloud computing.
抽象是雲計算的核心特性之一。

When choosing between cloud computing service models, organizations must decide the level of control and management they’ll require, or how much they want to hide technical details and focus on business needs.
在選擇雲計算服務模型時，組織必須決定所需的控制和管理級別，或者他們希望隱藏多少技術細節並專注於業務需求。

Let’s use a transportation analogy to see how on-premises, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS compare with each other.
讓我們用交通類比來看看本地、IaaS、PaaS 和 SaaS 如何相互比較。

On-premises IT infrastructure is like owning a car.
本地 IT 基礎設施就像擁有一輛汽車。

When you buy a car, you’re responsible for its usage and maintenance.
當您購買一輛汽車時，您負責其使用和維護。

Upgrading means buying a new car, which takes time and can be costly.
升級意味著購買新車，這需要時間且可能成本高昂。

IaaS is like leasing a car.
IaaS 就像租賃一輛汽車。

When you lease a car, you choose a car and drive it wherever you want, but the car isn’t yours.
當您租賃一輛汽車時，您選擇一輛汽車並隨心所欲地駕駛，但這輛汽車不是您的。

Upgrading is easier though, as you can just lease a new car.
然而，升級更容易，因為您可以直接租賃一輛新車。

PaaS is like taking a taxi.
PaaS 就像打出租車。

You provide specific directions, like the code, but the driver does the actual driving.
您提供具體的指示，如代碼，但實際駕駛由司機完成。

And SaaS is like going by bus.
而 SaaS 就像乘坐公共汽車。

You still get access to transport, but it's less customizable.
您仍然可以使用交通工具，但定制化程度較低。

Buses have designated routes, and you share the space with other passengers.
公共汽車有指定的路線，您與其他乘客共享空間。

### 1.3.3 IaaS(Infrastructure as a service)

Now let's look at each of these computing models in more detail.
現在讓我們更詳細地看看這些計算模型。

We’ll start with infrastructure as a service, or IaaS.
我們將從基礎設施即服務（IaaS）開始。

IaaS is a computing model that offers the on-demand availability of almost infinitely scalable infrastructure resources, such as compute, networking, storage, and databases as services over the internet.
IaaS 是一種計算模型，提供幾乎無限可擴展的基礎設施資源的按需可用性，例如計算、網絡、存儲和數據庫作為互聯網上的服務。

IaaS allows organizations to lease the resources they need instead of having to buy hardware outright, and they only pay for what they use.
IaaS 允許組織租賃所需的資源，而不必直接購買硬件，並且他們只需支付使用的費用。

It provides the same technologies and capabilities as a traditional data center without having to physically maintain or manage all of it.
它提供與傳統數據中心相同的技術和功能，而不必實際維護或管理所有這些設施。

One of the main reasons businesses choose IaaS is to reduce their capital expenditures and transform them into operational expenses.
企業選擇 IaaS 的主要原因之一是減少資本支出，並將其轉化為運營費用。

IaaS is appealing because acquiring computing resources to run applications or store data the traditional way requires time and capital.
IaaS 之所以吸引人，是因為以傳統方式獲取計算資源來運行應用程序或存儲數據需要時間和資本。

Organizations must purchase equipment through procurement processes that can take months.
組織必須通過可能需要數月的採購過程來購買設備。

They must also invest in physical spaces, which are typically specialized rooms with power and cooling.
他們還必須投資於物理空間，這些空間通常是具有電力和冷卻的專用房間。

And after deploying the systems, they need IT professionals to manage them.
在部署系統後，他們需要 IT 專業人員來管理它們。

This traditional way is challenging to scale when demand spikes or business grows.
當需求激增或業務增長時，這種傳統方式難以擴展。

Organizations risk running out of capacity, or overbuilding and ending up with underutilized infrastructure.
組織面臨容量不足或過度建設而最終導致基礎設施利用不足的風險。

In contrast, IaaS resources are offered as individual services, so organizations can choose what they need.
相比之下，IaaS 資源以單獨服務的形式提供，因此組織可以選擇所需的資源。

The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, and businesses can concentrate on installing, configuring, and managing software and keeping their data secure.
雲提供商管理基礎設施，企業可以專注於安裝、配置和管理軟件並保持數據安全。

Compute Engine and Cloud Storage are examples of Google Cloud IaaS products.
Compute Engine 和 Cloud Storage 是 Google Cloud IaaS 產品的例子。

You can create and run virtual machines with Compute Engine, and you can store any type of data with Cloud Storage.
您可以使用 Compute Engine 創建和運行虛擬機，並且可以使用 Cloud Storage 存儲任何類型的數據。

So, what are the benefits of IaaS?
那麼，IaaS 的好處是什麼？

It’s economical.
它是經濟的。

Because IaaS resources are used on demand and you only pay for what you use, IaaS costs are fairly predictable and easy to budget for.
由於 IaaS 資源是按需使用的，並且您只需支付使用的費用，因此 IaaS 成本相當可預測且易於預算。

It’s efficient.
它是高效的。

IaaS resources are regularly available when you need them.
當您需要時，IaaS 資源定期可用。

As a result, there are fewer delays when infrastructure is expanded, and resources aren’t wasted by overbuilding capacity.
因此，當基礎設施擴展時，延遲較少，資源不會因過度建設而浪費。

This efficiency leads to faster development lifecycles and ultimately a faster time to market.
這種效率導致更快的開發生命周期，並最終更快地推向市場。

It boosts productivity.
它提高了生產力。

Because the cloud provider is responsible for setting up and maintaining the physical infrastructure, IT departments save time and money.
由於雲提供商負責設置和維護物理基礎設施，IT 部門節省了時間和金錢。

They can then redirect resources to more strategic activities.
然後他們可以將資源重新分配到更具戰略性的活動中。

It’s reliable.
它是可靠的。

IaaS has no single point of failure.
IaaS 沒有單一故障點。

Even if one component of the hardware resources fails, the service usually remains available.
即使硬件資源的某個組件故障，服務通常仍然可用。

And it’s scalable.
而且它是可擴展的。

One of the biggest advantages of IaaS in cloud computing is the capability to scale the resources up and down rapidly according to business needs.
雲計算中 IaaS 的最大優勢之一是能夠根據業務需求快速擴展和縮減資源。

So, what scenarios would IaaS be good for?
那麼，IaaS 適用於哪些場景？

The flexibility and scalability of IaaS is useful for organizations that:
IaaS 的靈活性和可擴展性對於以下組織非常有用：

-   Require more infrastructure scalability and agility than traditional data centers can provide.
-   需要比傳統數據中心提供更多的基礎設施可擴展性和靈活性。

-   Have high business growth that outpaces infrastructure capabilities.
-   具有超過基礎設施能力的高業務增長。

-   Experience unpredictable spikes in demand for infrastructure services.
-   遇到基礎設施服務需求不可預測的峰值。

-   And see low utilization of existing infrastructure resources.
-   以及看到現有基礎設施資源的利用率低。

### 1.3.4 PaaS(Platform as a service)

Platform as a Service, or PaaS, is a computing model that offers a cloud-based platform for developing, running, and managing applications.
平臺即服務（PaaS）是一種計算模型，為開發、執行和管理應用程式提供了基於雲的平臺。

PaaS provides a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications.
PaaS 為開發人員提供了一個框架，他們可以在此基礎上構建並用於建立自定義應用程式。

PaaS is appealing because it provides a platform for developers to develop, run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the associated infrastructure.
PaaS 很有吸引力，因為它為開發人員提供了一個平臺來開發、執行和管理自己的應用程式，而無需構建和維護相關基礎設施。

They can also use built-in software components to build their applications, which reduces the amount of code they have to write.
他們還可以使用內建軟體元件來構建應用程式，這減少了他們必須編寫的程式量。

Cloud Run and BigQuery are examples of Google Cloud PaaS products.
Cloud Run 和 BigQuery 是 Google Cloud PaaS 產品的例子。

Cloud Run is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting applications at scale, which takes care of provisioning servers and scaling app instances based on demand.
Cloud Run 是一個完全託管的無伺服器平臺，用於大規模開發和託管應用程式，它負責根據需求配置伺服器和擴充套件應用程式例項。

BigQuery is a fully managed enterprise data warehouse that manages and analyzes data, and can be queried to answer big data questions with zero infrastructure management.
BigQuery 是一個完全託管的企業資料倉庫，可以管理和分析資料，並且可以查詢以零基礎設施管理來回答大資料問題。

So, what are the benefits of PaaS?
那麼，PaaS 的好處是什麼？

It reduces development time.
它減少了開發時間。

Developers can go straight to coding instead of spending time setting up and maintaining a development environment, which leads to faster time to market.
開發人員可以直接進行編碼，而不是花時間設定和維護開發環境，這會加快上市時間。

It's scalable.
它是可擴充套件的。

With PaaS, organizations can purchase additional capacity for building, testing, staging, and running applications whenever they need it.
藉助 PaaS，組織可以隨時購買額外的能力來構建、測試、暫存和執行應用程式。

It also allows for applications to be designed to take advantage of the inherent scalability of cloud infrastructure.
它還允許設計應用程式，以利用雲基礎設施的內在可擴充套件性。

It reduces management.
它減少了管理。

By abstracting the management of underlying resources even further than IaaS, PaaS offloads infrastructure management, patches, updates, and other administrative tasks to the cloud service provider.
透過將基礎資源的管理抽象得比 IaaS 更遠，PaaS 將基礎設施管理、補丁、更新和其他管理任務解除安裝給雲服務提供商。

This provides a cost-effective way to focus on new functionality.
這為專注於新功能提供了一種具有成本效益的方式。

And it's flexible.
而且它很靈活。

With support for different programming languages and easy collaboration for distributed teams, PaaS provides developers with the flexibility to deliver various projects—from prototypes to enterprise solutions—on the same platform.
透過支援不同的寫程式語言和分散式團隊的輕鬆協作，PaaS 為開發人員提供了在同一平臺上交付各種專案（從原型到企業解決方案）的靈活性。

So, what scenarios would PaaS be good for?
那麼，PaaS 對哪些場景有好處？

PaaS is suitable for organizations that: Want to create unique and custom applications without investing a lot in owning and managing infrastructure.
PaaS 適用於以下組織：想要建立獨特的自定義應用程式，而無需在擁有和管理基礎設施方面投入大量投資。

Want to rapidly test and deploy applications.
想要快速測試和部署應用程式。

Have many legacy applications and want to reduce the cost of operations.
有許多遺留應用程式，並希望降低運營成本。

Have a new app project that they want to deploy quickly by growing and updating the app as fast as possible.
擁有一個新的應用程式專案，他們希望透過儘可能快地增長和更新應用程式來快速部署。

Want to only pay for resources while they're being used.
只想在資源使用時支付費用。

And want to offload time-consuming tasks such as setting up and maintaining application servers and development and testing environments.
並希望解除安裝耗時的任務，例如設定和維護應用程式伺服器以及開發和測試環境。

### 1.3.5 SaaS(Software as a service)

Software as a service, or SaaS, is a computing model that offers an entire application, managed by a cloud provider, through a web browser.
軟體即服務（SaaS）是一種計算模型，提供由雲提供商透過網頁瀏覽器管理的整個應用程式。

The cloud provider hosts the application software in the cloud and delivers it through a browser.
雲提供商在雲中託管應用軟體，並透過瀏覽器交付。

With this model, you don't need to download or install any of it.
使用此型號，您無需下載或安裝任何型號。

SaaS is appealing because it abstracts technology completely from the consumer; the end user doesn't need to care about the underlying infrastructure, which is the cloud provider's responsibility.
SaaS 很有吸引力，因為它完全從消費者那裡抽象了技術；終端使用者不需要關心基礎基礎設施，這是雲提供商的責任。

Organizations simply pay a subscription fee for access to a ready-to-use software product.
組織只需為訪問現成的軟體產品支付訂閱費。

Google Workspace, which includes tools such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Meet, is a Google Cloud SaaS product.
Google Workspace 包括 Gmail、Google Drive、Google Docs 和 Google Meet 等工具，是 Google Cloud SaaS 產品。

So, what are the benefits of SaaS?
那麼，SaaS 的好處是什麼？

It's low maintenance.
維護成本低。

SaaS eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install applications on each individual computer.
SaaS 無需讓 IT 人員在每臺計算機上下載和安裝應用程式。

With SaaS, vendors manage all potential technical issues, such as data, servers, storage, and updates in the cloud.
使用 SaaS，供應商可以管理所有潛在的技術問題，如資料、伺服器、儲存和雲中的更新。

This helps to streamline maintenance and support for an organization.
這有助於簡化組織的維護和支援。

It's cost-effective.
這很划算。

SaaS is based on a subscription model with a fixed, inclusive, monthly or annual account fee.
SaaS 基於具有固定、包容性、月度或年度帳戶費用的訂閱模式。

Predictable costs and per-user budgeting allows for clear financial governance.
可預測的成本和每個使用者的預算允許明確的財務治理。

It's flexible.
它很靈活。

Everything is available over the internet when a user signs in to their personalized account online.
當使用者線上登入他們的個性化帳戶時，一切都可以透過網際網路獲得。

They can access the software from anywhere, any device, anytime.
他們可以隨時從任何地方、任何裝置訪問軟體。

And what scenarios would SaaS be good for?
SaaS 適用於哪些場景？

Well, SaaS is suitable for organizations that: Well, SaaS is suitable for organizations that: Want to use standard software solutions that require minimal customization.
好吧，SaaS 適合以下組織：好吧，SaaS 適合以下組織：希望使用需要最小定製的標準軟體解決方案。

Don't want to invest time or internal expertise in maintaining applications or infrastructure.
不想在維護應用程式或基礎設施上投入時間或內部專業知識。

Need more time for IT teams to focus on strategic projects.
IT 團隊需要更多時間來專注於戰略專案。

And need to access apps from various devices and locations.
需要從各種裝置和位置訪問應用程式。

### 1.3.6 Choosing a cloud computing model

So, how does an organization decide which cloud computing model is the best option for them?
那麼，組織如何決定哪種雲計算模型最適合他們呢？

The answer depends on their business needs, required functionality, and available expertise.
答案取決於他們的業務需求、所需功能和可用專業知識。

If they are looking for a highly flexible, scalable service—while maintaining control of their infrastructure—then IaaS is the right choice.
如果他們尋求高度靈活、可擴展的服務，同時保持對其基礎設施的控制，那麼 IaaS 是正確的選擇。

This model offers the most control and customization, but also requires the most management responsibilities and technical expertise.
這種模型提供最多的控制和定制，但也需要最多的管理責任和技術專業知識。

If they need a platform designed for building software products, then PaaS would help their business immediately.
如果他們需要一個專為構建軟件產品而設計的平台，那麼 PaaS 會立即幫助他們的業務。

This provides a cost-effective way to build applications, but still requires some technical expertise and less management.
這提供了一種具有成本效益的構建應用程序的方法，但仍然需要一些技術專業知識和較少的管理。

If they want features that are ready to use, without the hassle of installations, then SaaS might be the best option.
如果他們希望擁有現成可用的功能，而不需要安裝的麻煩，那麼 SaaS 可能是最佳選擇。

This represents the least management responsibilities and technical expertise, but also offers the least control and customization.
這代表了最少的管理責任和技術專業知識，但也提供了最少的控制和定制。

These computing models are not mutually exclusive, though.
然而，這些計算模型並不是相互排斥的。

Depending on the use case, most organizations will use combinations of all three to solve for different business needs.
根據具體用例，大多數組織將使用這三者的組合來解決不同的業務需求。

They’ll need to compare their options based on variables such as management level, control, responsibility, flexibility, and expertise needed.
他們需要根據管理級別、控制、責任、靈活性和所需專業知識等變量來比較他們的選擇。

For example, imagine a large organization needs to implement a new inventory management system.
例如，假設一個大型組織需要實施一個新的庫存管理系統。

If they had the in-house expertise to develop it and the willingness to manage the infrastructure, they could build this with IaaS resources.
如果他們有內部專業知識來開發它並願意管理基礎設施，他們可以使用 IaaS 資源來構建這個系統。

The organization's IT team would have complete control over server configurations, but also bear the burden of managing and maintaining them.
該組織的 IT 團隊將完全控制服務器配置，但也承擔管理和維護它們的負擔。

They could choose a PaaS solution and build a custom CRM application while offloading management of infrastructure to the cloud service provider; retaining complete control over application features, but reducing the management load.
他們可以選擇 PaaS 解決方案並構建定制的 CRM 應用程序，同時將基礎設施管理轉移給雲服務提供商；保留對應用功能的完全控制，但減少管理負擔。

Finally, they could choose to buy a ready-made SaaS solution; having no daily management of infrastructure, but also giving up all control over features and functionality in the software.
最後，他們可以選擇購買現成的 SaaS 解決方案；無需日常管理基礎設施，但也放棄了對軟件功能和功能的所有控制。

Each of these options is a viable solution, so organizations must compare the benefits and tradeoffs for each use case.
每個選項都是可行的解決方案，因此組織必須比較每個用例的優勢和權衡。

These cloud computing service models give organizations choices, flexibility, and options that on-premises hosting simply can’t provide.
這些雲計算服務模型為組織提供了本地託管無法提供的選擇、靈活性和選項。

### 1.3.7 The shared responsibility model

One area of responsibility where each of the cloud computing models differ is security.
雲計算模型之間在責任方面不同的一個領域是安全性。

When an organization manages its data in its own data centers, that organization is responsible for all aspects of its security.
當組織在自己的數據中心管理數據時，該組織對其安全性的各個方面負責。

However, as infrastructure is moved to the cloud, some aspects of the responsibility shift to the cloud provider.
然而，隨著基礎設施遷移到雲端，一些責任方面轉移到雲提供商。

This concept is called the shared responsibility model.
這個概念被稱為共享責任模型。

Security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer.
雲中的安全性是雲提供商和客戶之間的共享責任。

Although direct responsibilities change based on the cloud computing service model, organizations are always in control of securing their data, and the cloud provider is always responsible for securing the infrastructure.
雖然直接責任根據雲計算服務模型而變化，但組織總是控制其數據的安全性，而雲提供商總是負責基礎設施的安全性。

At Google Cloud, we defend organizations’ data against threats and fraudulent activity with the same infrastructure and security services we use for our own operations.
在 Google Cloud，我們使用與我們自己運營相同的基礎設施和安全服務來保護組織的數據免受威脅和欺詐活動。

However, security of the cloud and security in the cloud are two different things.
然而，雲的安全性和雲中的安全性是兩個不同的概念。

Simply put, the cloud provider is responsible for the security of the cloud, while the customer is responsible for security in the cloud.
簡而言之，雲提供商負責雲的安全性，而客戶負責雲中的安全性。

It's important for organizations to understand how the specific customer responsibilities vary according to the type of cloud computing model used.
對於組織來說，了解根據所使用的雲計算模型的不同，具體的客戶責任如何變化是很重要的。

This is especially important because, according to a Gartner report, 99% of all cloud security failures will result from user error through the year 2025.
這一點尤為重要，因為根據 Gartner 報告，到 2025 年，99%的雲安全失敗將由用戶錯誤導致。

Organizations must understand their roles and responsibilities in cloud security to guarantee it.
組織必須了解其在雲安全中的角色和責任，以確保安全。

### 1.3.8 How the shared responsibility model works

If you look at the various cloud computing models together, you can see where the cloud provider’s responsibility ends and where the customer's responsibility begins.
如果您將各種雲計算模型放在一起查看，您可以看到雲提供商的責任結束的地方和客戶的責任開始的地方。

A general guideline for shared responsibility is that "if you configure or store it, you're responsible for securing it."
共享責任的一般指導原則是“如果您配置或存儲它，您就負責保護它的安全”。

This generally means that a cloud provider is responsible for securing the parts of the cloud that it directly controls, such as hardware, networks, and physical security.
這通常意味著雲提供商負責保護其直接控制的雲部分，如硬件、網絡和物理安全。

At the same time, the customer is responsible for securing anything that they create within the cloud, such as the configurations, access policies, and user data.
同時，客戶負責保護他們在雲中創建的任何內容，如配置、訪問策略和用戶數據。

No matter which cloud provider you use, there is shared responsibility.
無論您使用哪個雲提供商，都存在共享責任。

Let’s examine the ratios of responsibility between Google Cloud as a service provider and our customers.
讓我們來看看 Google Cloud 作為服務提供商與我們的客戶之間的責任比例。

The blue squares represent the parts of the infrastructure security that the customer is responsible for, while the yellow squares represent the elements that Google Cloud is responsible for.
藍色方塊代表客戶負責的基礎設施安全部分，而黃色方塊代表 Google Cloud 負責的元素。

Let's begin with on-premises.
讓我們從本地開始。

When an organization runs its own on-premises data centers, security for the infrastructure is solely the responsibility of the organization's internal teams.
當組織運營自己的本地數據中心時，基礎設施的安全性完全由組織的內部團隊負責。

They are responsible for securing servers and the data stored on them.
他們負責保護服務器及其上存儲的數據的安全。

Next is infrastructure as a service.
接下來是基礎設施即服務（IaaS）。

When an organization transitions to an IaaS computing model, it assigns some IT security responsibilities to Google Cloud.
當組織轉向 IaaS 計算模型時，它將一些 IT 安全責任分配給 Google Cloud。

This includes being responsible for the physical resources and sharing responsibility with the customer for the security of the infrastructure and network.
這包括負責物理資源，並與客戶共享基礎設施和網絡的安全責任。

The rest, such as the security of the operating system, software stack required to run their applications, and their data, is the responsibility of the customer.
其餘部分，如操作系統的安全性、運行應用程序所需的軟件棧及其數據的安全性，則由客戶負責。

This allows customers the most freedom and control, but also places most of the responsibility in their hands.
這使得客戶擁有最大的自由和控制，但也將大部分責任交到他們手中。

When an organization uses the platform as a service model, more of the responsibility is passed over to Google Cloud.
當組織使用平台即服務（PaaS）模型時，更多的責任轉移到 Google Cloud。

This includes full responsibility for the physical infrastructure, the access and authentication, network security, and guest operating systems.
這包括對物理基礎設施、訪問和身份驗證、網絡安全和來賓操作系統的全部責任。

The customer is still responsible for the security of any content, such as code or data, produced on the platform.
客戶仍然負責平台上生成的任何內容（如代碼或數據）的安全性。

Lastly, with the software as a service model, Google Cloud is responsible for almost every aspect of security—from the underlying infrastructure to the actual application.
最後，使用軟件即服務（SaaS）模型時，Google Cloud 幾乎負責所有方面的安全性——從底層基礎設施到實際應用程序。

Customers still have some security responsibilities, such as application usage, access policies like authentication settings to prevent phishing attacks, and the user content.
客戶仍然有一些安全責任，如應用程序使用、訪問策略（如身份驗證設置以防止網絡釣魚攻擊）和用戶內容。

One important aspect of the shared responsibility model is that customers are always responsible for the security of their data, whether they have on-premises data centers or only pay a monthly subscription for a single user license.
共享責任模型的一個重要方面是，無論客戶是擁有本地數據中心還是僅支付單用戶許可的月度訂閱費，他們始終負責其數據的安全性。

The customer controls who or what has access to their data.
客戶控制誰或什麼可以訪問他們的數據。

Google Cloud is committed to keeping customers’ data secure, but security is a shared responsibility and requires collaboration.
Google Cloud 致力於保持客戶數據的安全，但安全性是一種共享責任，並需要協作。
