# 2. Exploring Data Transformation with Google Cloud

## 2.1 The Value of Data

### 2.1.1 How data creates value
Data is an essential ingredient for driving innovation and differentiation, and is the key to unlocking value from artificial intelligence.
數據是推動創新和差異化的重要因素，是釋放人工智能價值的關鍵。

Data powers AI-driven business insights, helps companies make better real-time decisions, and is the basis for how companies build and run their applications.
數據為AI驅動的業務洞察提供動力，幫助公司做出更好的實時決策，是公司構建和運行應用程序的基礎。

We’re generating more data every day, and the complexity and speed of data arrival are changing the business environment.
我們每天都在生成更多的數據，數據到達的複雜性和速度正在改變業務環境。

However, the most valuable insights no longer come just from sales, inventory, and personnel data.
然而，最有價值的洞察不再僅來自銷售、庫存和人事數據。

They are often hidden across unstructured data points from a myriad of sources and systems.
它們往往隱藏在來自各種來源和系統的非結構化數據點中。

Extracting the insights requires the right blend of tools, skills, and strategy.
提取這些洞察需要合適的工具、技能和策略的結合。

Some data is easy to capture like financial data, because it can be found in databases and spreadsheets.
有些數據易於捕獲，如財務數據，因為它可以在數據庫和電子表格中找到。

But other data might not be as easy, for example, how your customers engage with you across social media platforms.
但其他數據可能不那麼容易，例如，您的客戶如何在社交媒體平台上與您互動。

And after you capture data, how do you store it so that you can gain insights from it?
捕獲數據後，如何存儲以便從中獲得洞察？

With machine learning, or ML, and artificial intelligence, or AI, organizations can generate insights from data, both past and present, and can also perceive, predict, recommend, and categorize data in new ways.
通過機器學習（ML）和人工智能（AI），組織可以從過去和現在的數據中生成洞察，還可以以新的方式感知、預測、推薦和分類數據。

For example, ML lets online retailers who use smart analytics tools to ingest real-time customer behavior data while they surface the best suggestions for particular users.
例如，ML允許在線零售商使用智能分析工具攝取實時的客戶行為數據，同時為特定用戶提供最佳建議。

So with every click that the user makes, their website experience becomes increasingly personalized.
因此，隨著用戶的每一次點擊，他們的網站體驗變得越來越個性化。

However, some organizations struggle to remove the barriers that sit between them and their data.
然而，一些組織難以消除它們與數據之間的障礙。

According to a report by Accenture titled “Closing the data value gap,” 68% of organizations say they are still unable to realize tangible and measurable value from data.
根據埃森哲題為《縮小數據價值差距》的報告，68%的組織表示它們仍然無法從數據中實現具體和可衡量的價值。

Organizations that want to adapt must determine how to close the gap and support value generation.
希望適應的組織必須確定如何縮小差距並支持價值創造。

An intelligent data cloud is the key to unlocking more business value.
智能數據雲是釋放更多業務價值的關鍵。


### 2.1.2 Unlocking business value from data

Unlocking the value of data is central to digital transformation.
釋放數據價值是數字化轉型的核心。

To generate insights, you might need to combine different types of data.
為了生成洞察，您可能需要結合不同類型的數據。

However, not all data is created and organized the same way.
然而，並非所有數據都是以相同方式創建和組織的。

Data can be categorized into three main types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.
數據可以分為三種類型：結構化數據、半結構化數據和非結構化數據。

Structured data is highly organized and well-defined.
結構化數據是高度組織化和明確定義的。

It’s typically stored in a table with relationships between the different rows and columns, like in a spreadsheet or database.
它通常存儲在一個表中，行和列之間有關係，就像電子表格或數據庫中的數據一樣。

Because structured data is organized in this way, it is easy to analyze.
由於結構化數據是以這種方式組織的，因此它易於分析。

For example, it’s common for organizations to use structured data in customer relationship management tools, or CRMs, as they follow customer behavior patterns and trends.
例如，組織通常在客戶關係管理工具（CRM）中使用結構化數據，因為它們跟蹤客戶行為模式和趨勢。

Semi-structured data falls somewhere in between structured and unstructured data.
半結構化數據介於結構化數據和非結構化數據之間。

It’s organized into a hierarchy, but without full differentiation or any particular ordering.
它組織成一個層次結構，但沒有完全區分或任何特定順序。

Examples include emails, HTML, JSON, and XML files.
示例包括電子郵件、HTML、JSON和XML文件。

Although this data type doesn’t have a formal structure, it contains tags or other markers that make it easier to analyze than unstructured data.
雖然這種類型的數據沒有正式結構，但它包含標籤或其他標記，使其比非結構化數據更容易分析。

Unstructured data is information that either doesn’t have a predefined data model or isn’t organized in a predefined manner.
非結構化數據是指沒有預定義數據模型或未按預定義方式組織的信息。

Categories include:
類別包括：

Text, which is the most common, and is often generated and collected from sources like documents, presentations, or even social media posts.
文本數據是最常見的，通常來自文檔、演示文稿甚至社交媒體帖子。

Data files, like images, audio files, and videos.
數據文件，如圖像、音頻文件和視頻。

And infrastructure activity and performance data, like log files from servers, networks, and applications or output data from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.
以及基礎設施活動和性能數據，如來自服務器、網絡和應用程序的日誌文件或物聯網（IoT）傳感器的輸出數據。

Organizations can use unstructured data in many ways.
組織可以以多種方式使用非結構化數據。

For example, a marketing team might analyze social media posts to identify sentiment toward a brand.
例如，營銷團隊可能會分析社交媒體帖子以識別對品牌的情感。

Or customer service teams might train automated chatbots to augment support staff by analyzing language in customer communications and providing interactive responses.
或客戶服務團隊可能會訓練自動聊天機器人，通過分析客戶溝通中的語言並提供互動響應來增強支持人員。

But in general, unstructured data has historically been difficult to analyze.
但總的來說，歷史上非結構化數據很難分析。

According to Harvard Business Review, on average less than 1% of an organization’s unstructured data is analyzed or used at all.
根據《哈佛商業評論》，平均來說，組織的非結構化數據中只有不到1%被分析或使用。

Until recently, tools to tap the potential of unstructured data were either unavailable or prohibitively expensive and complex.
直到最近，挖掘非結構化數據潛力的工具要么不可用，要么成本高昂且複雜。

What makes this statistic even more concerning is that, according to Gartner research, unstructured data represents 80% to 90% of all new enterprise data.
更令人擔憂的是，根據Gartner的研究，非結構化數據佔所有新企業數據的80%到90%。

This reveals a staggering gap between the data being generated and the value that it's providing.
這揭示了生成數據和其提供的價值之間存在巨大差距。

But, cloud technology has changed that.
但是，雲技術改變了這一點。

With the right cloud tools, businesses can extract value from unstructured data by using machine learning to discover trends, or even using application programming interfaces, or APIs, to extract structure from the data.
使用合適的雲工具，企業可以利用機器學習從非結構化數據中發現趨勢，甚至使用應用程序接口（API）從數據中提取結構。

An example of an API is Google Cloud’s Vision API, which uses machine learning to detect products within a picture and can then even label the picture to describe its contents.
API的一個例子是Google Cloud的Vision API，它使用機器學習來檢測圖像中的產品，然後甚至可以標記圖像以描述其內容。

Understanding the different types of data available can help organizations define what’s possible with the data solutions they have.
了解可用的不同類型數據可以幫助組織確定他們擁有的數據解決方案的可能性。

One of the transformative powers of the cloud is how it can unlock value from structured and the previously untapped, unstructured data.
雲的一個變革力量是它如何釋放結構化數據和以前未開發的非結構化數據的價值。


### 2.1.3 Data management concepts

Organizations need a modern approach to enterprise data to manage the vast volumes that are produced.
組織需要現代化的企業數據管理方法來管理產生的大量數據。

The list of options often includes databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
選項通常包括數據庫、數據倉庫和數據湖。

Let’s explore each of these options starting with databases.
讓我們從數據庫開始，探討這些選項中的每一個。

A database is an organized collection of data stored in tables and accessed electronically from a computer system.
數據庫是一個有組織的數據集合，存儲在表中，可以通過計算機系統電子訪問。

Let’s examine two types of databases: relational and non-relational.
讓我們來看看兩種類型的數據庫：關係型數據庫和非關係型數據庫。

A relational database stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
關係型數據庫存儲和提供彼此相關的數據點的訪問。

This means storing information in tables, rows, and columns that have a clearly defined schema that represents the structure or logical configuration of the database.
這意味著將信息存儲在具有明確定義的模式的表、行和列中，這些模式表示數據庫的結構或邏輯配置。

A relational database can establish links—or relationships–between information by joining tables, and structured query language, or SQL, can be used to query and manipulate data.
關係型數據庫可以通過連接表來建立信息之間的鏈接或關係，可以使用結構化查詢語言（SQL）查詢和操作數據。

Relational databases are highly consistent, reliable, and best suited for dealing with large amounts of structured data.
關係型數據庫具有高度一致性和可靠性，最適合處理大量結構化數據。

They’re designed for business data processing and storing the online transactional data needed to support the daily operations of a company.
它們專為業務數據處理和存儲支持公司日常運營所需的在線交易數據而設計。

A non-relational database, sometimes known as a NoSQL database, is less structured in format and doesn’t use a tabular format of rows and columns like relational databases.
非關係型數據庫，有時稱為NoSQL數據庫，結構較少，不使用行和列的表格格式，如關係型數據庫。

Instead, non-relational databases follow a flexible data model, which makes them ideal for storing data that changes its organization frequently or for applications that handle diverse types of data.
相反，非關係型數據庫遵循靈活的數據模型，這使它們非常適合存儲組織經常變化的數據或處理各種類型數據的應用程序。

This includes when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized, or when the data regularly evolves to meet new business requirements.
這包括需要組織大量複雜和多樣數據的情況，或者數據經常演變以滿足新的業務需求。

Choosing the right database depends on the use case.
選擇合適的數據庫取決於用例。

Google Cloud relational database products include Cloud SQL and Spanner, while Bigtable is a non-relational database product.
Google Cloud的關係型數據庫產品包括Cloud SQL和Spanner，而Bigtable是一種非關係型數據庫產品。

We’ll look at these products in more detail later.
我們稍後會更詳細地了解這些產品。

Let’s explore another data management concept, the data warehouse.
讓我們來探討另一個數據管理概念，數據倉庫。

Like a database, a data warehouse is a place to store data.
與數據庫一樣，數據倉庫是存儲數據的地方。

However, while a database is designed to capture data for storage, retrieval, and use, a data warehouse is designed to analyze data.
然而，數據庫旨在捕獲數據以進行存儲、檢索和使用，而數據倉庫則旨在分析數據。

A data warehouse is an enterprise system used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources.
數據倉庫是一種企業系統，用於分析和報告來自多個來源的結構化和半結構化數據。

Think of the data warehouse as the central hub for all business data.
將數據倉庫視為所有業務數據的中央樞紐。

Business data might include point-of-sale transactions, marketing automation, or even customer relationship management data.
業務數據可能包括銷售點交易、營銷自動化，甚至是客戶關係管理數據。

Suited for both ad hoc analysis and custom reporting, a data warehouse can help analyze sales and identify trends, because it can store both current and historical data in one place.
適合臨時分析和自定義報告，數據倉庫可以幫助分析銷售和識別趨勢，因為它可以將當前和歷史數據存儲在一個地方。

This capability can provide a long-range view of data over time, which makes a data warehouse a primary component of business intelligence.
這種能力可以提供長期的數據視圖，使數據倉庫成為商業智能的主要組成部分。

BigQuery is Google Cloud's data warehouse offering.
BigQuery是Google Cloud的數據倉庫產品。

We’ll explore BigQuery in more detail later.
我們稍後會更詳細地了解BigQuery。

Although data warehouses handle structured and semi-structured data, they’re not typically the answer for how to handle large amounts of available unstructured data, like images, videos, and documents.
雖然數據倉庫處理結構化和半結構化數據，但它們通常不是處理大量可用非結構化數據（如圖像、視頻和文檔）的答案。

Unstructured data, which doesn't conform to a well-defined schema, is often disregarded in traditional analytics.
不符合明確模式的非結構化數據通常在傳統分析中被忽視。

A data lake is a repository designed to ingest, store, explore, process, and analyze any type or volume of raw data, regardless of the source, like operational systems, web sources, social media, or Internet of Things, or IoT.
數據湖是一個用於攝取、存儲、探索、處理和分析任何類型或數量原始數據的存儲庫，無論是操作系統、網絡來源、社交媒體還是物聯網（IoT）。

It can store different types of data in its original format; ignoring size limits, and without much pre-processing or adding structure.
它可以以原始格式存儲不同類型的數據；忽略大小限制，且不需進行大量預處理或添加結構。

Having this unprocessed, raw data available for analysis prevents unintentionally contaminating the data or adding bias.
擁有這些未經處理的原始數據可供分析，可以防止無意中污染數據或添加偏見。

It also means that the raw data can be enriched by merging it with other data at the same time.
這也意味著原始數據可以通過與其他數據同時合併來豐富。

This differs from a data warehouse that contains structured data that has been cleaned and processed, ready for strategic analysis based on predefined business needs.
這不同於數據倉庫，數據倉庫包含已清理和處理的結構化數據，為基於預定業務需求的戰略分析做好準備。

Data lakes often consist of many different products, depending on the nature of the data that is ingested.
數據湖通常由許多不同的產品組成，具體取決於攝取數據的性質。

For example, the best Google Cloud products for storing structured data are Cloud SQL, Spanner, or BigQuery.
例如，存儲結構化數據的最佳Google Cloud產品是Cloud SQL、Spanner或BigQuery。

For semi-structured data, the options include Datastore and Bigtable.
對於半結構化數據，選項包括Datastore和Bigtable。

And for storing unstructured data, Cloud Storage is an option.
對於存儲非結構化數據，Cloud Storage是一個選項。

Data warehouses and data lakes should be considered complementary instead of competing tools.
數據倉庫和數據湖應被視為互補工具，而不是競爭工具。

Although both store data in some capacity, each is optimized for different uses.
雖然兩者都在某種程度上存儲數據，但每個工具都針對不同的用途進行了優化。

Traditional data warehouse users are business intelligence analysts who are closer to the business and focus on driving insights from data.
傳統數據倉庫用戶是業務智能分析師，他們更接近業務並專注於從數據中獲取洞察。

These users traditionally use the data to answer questions.
這些用戶傳統上使用數據來回答問題。

Data lake users, and also analysts, include data engineers and data scientists.
數據湖用戶以及分析師包括數據工程師和數據科學家。

They’re closer to the raw data with the tools and capabilities to explore, mine, and experiment with the data.
他們更接近原始數據，並擁有探索、挖掘和試驗數據的工具和能力。

These users find answers in the data, but they also find questions.
這些用戶在數據中找到答案，但他們也找到問題。

As enterprises are increasingly focused on data-driven decision making, data warehouses and data lakes play a critical role in an organization’s digital transformation journey.
隨著企業越來越專注於數據驅動的決策，數據倉庫和數據湖在組織的數字化轉型旅程中發揮著關鍵作用。

Democratization of data lets users gain a deeper understanding of business situations because they have more context than ever before.
數據的民主化使用戶能夠更深入地了解業務情況，因為他們擁有比以往更多的背景信息。

Today, organizations need a 360-degree real-time view of their businesses to gain a competitive edge.
今天，組織需要360度的實時業務視圖，以獲得競爭優勢。



### 2.1.4 The role of data in digital transformation

Organizations have access to data like never before.
組織對數據的訪問能力前所未有。

This includes both internal information, called first-party data, and external information, which is usually data about customers and industry, often called second or third-party data.
這包括內部信息，稱為第一方數據，以及外部信息，通常是關於客戶和行業的數據，通常稱為第二方或第三方數據。

As organizations have digitized their operations, many types of business data have become available, including information about their customers.
隨著組織數字化運營，各種類型的業務數據變得可用，包括關於其客戶的信息。

First-party data is the proprietary customer datasets that a business collects from customer or audience transactions and interactions.
第一方數據是企業從客戶或受眾的交易和互動中收集的專有客戶數據集。

These datasets might include information about digital interactions, like the length of time a user spends on a web page.
這些數據集可能包括關於數字互動的信息，例如用戶在網頁上花費的時間長度。

Second-party data often describes first-party data from another organization, such as a partner or other business in their supply chain, that can be easily deployed to augment a company's internal datasets.
第二方數據通常描述來自另一個組織的第一方數據，例如合作夥伴或供應鏈中的其他企業，可以輕鬆部署以增強公司的內部數據集。

The organization does not directly own this data, but it’s relevant to their business.
該組織不直接擁有這些數據，但它們與其業務相關。

Finally, there’s third-party data, which are datasets collected and managed by organizations that don’t directly interact with an organization's customers or business.
最後是第三方數據，這些數據集由不直接與組織的客戶或業務互動的組織收集和管理。

These datasets might come from government, nonprofit, or academic sources, like weather or public demographic data, or from industry-specific sources like analyst reports or industry benchmarking.
這些數據集可能來自政府、非營利組織或學術來源，如天氣或公共人口數據，或來自行業特定來源，如分析師報告或行業基準。

Third-party data is often shared or purchased on data marketplaces or exchanges, such as the Google Cloud Marketplace.
第三方數據通常在數據市場或交易所共享或購買，例如Google Cloud Marketplace。

Using external data can greatly increase the value of data by providing new context and insights.
使用外部數據可以通過提供新的背景和見解大大提高數據的價值。

Let’s explore an example of how an airline transformed their business through data.
讓我們來看看一個航空公司如何通過數據改變其業務的例子。

Budget airlines don't provide food as part of their service.
廉價航空公司不提供食品作為其服務的一部分。

Instead, they charge customers for meals if they want them.
相反，如果客戶需要餐食，他們會收取費用。

This solution might seem cost-effective, but it can be difficult to estimate the number of meals required onboard.
這種解決方案看似經濟有效，但估算機上所需餐食數量可能很困難。

If the airline overestimates the number of meals needed, they risk wasting food and losing revenue.
如果航空公司高估了所需餐食的數量，他們將面臨浪費食物和損失收入的風險。

But if they underestimate, they risk selling out of food; providing poor customer service and losing potential revenue.
但如果他們低估了，他們將面臨餐食售罄的風險；提供劣質的客戶服務並失去潛在收入。

One budget airline in Asia reimagined how they could solve this problem by using data.
亞洲的一家廉價航空公司重新設想了如何通過數據解決這個問題。

They began by identifying factors to help estimate stock, such as the size of the plane and the number of passengers.
他們首先確定了幫助估算存貨的因素，如飛機的大小和乘客數量。

But they soon discovered that estimates based on these factors were inaccurate.
但他們很快發現，基於這些因素的估算是不準確的。

This meant having to think about their data differently by analyzing information such as destination, time of flight, and flight connections before and after each journey.
這意味著需要不同地思考他們的數據，通過分析例如目的地、航班時間以及每次旅程前後的航班連接等信息。

Using this information, they uncovered actionable insights.
利用這些信息，他們發現了可行的見解。

For example, they learned that flights to and from India required 73% more vegetarian meals.
例如，他們了解到往返印度的航班需要多出73%的素食餐。

With these new insights, the airline was able to predict the number of meals required more accurately, which in turn provided a more positive customer experience and improved the profitability of their food service.
通過這些新的見解，航空公司能夠更準確地預測所需的餐食數量，從而提供更積極的客戶體驗並提高其餐飲服務的盈利能力。

This is just one example of how cloud technology can unlock new value by reimagining data.
這只是雲技術如何通過重新設想數據釋放新價值的一個例子。

No matter where you are in your company, you too can use data to solve challenges.
無論您在公司的哪個位置，您也可以使用數據來解決挑戰。



### 2.1.5 The data value chain
數據價值鏈

When you think about data processing, it's important to place it within the broader context of the data value chain.
當考慮數據處理時，將其置於數據價值鏈的更廣泛背景中是很重要的。

Imagine data traveling along an assembly line, like a car in a factory.
想像數據沿著裝配線移動，就像工廠中的汽車一樣。

The assembly line progressively adds parts and value to an object that moves along it.
裝配線逐步為沿線移動的對象添加零件和價值。

Raw data at the beginning of the line is eventually transformed into actions that humans or machines take.
裝配線起點的原始數據最終會轉化為人或機器採取的行動。

Let’s examine the steps in this data value chain.
讓我們來看看這個數據價值鏈中的步驟。

Data genesis is the initial creation of a unit of data; this could be a click on a website, the swipe of a card, a sensor recording from an IoT device, or countless other examples.
數據生成是數據單位的初始創建；這可能是網站上的點擊、刷卡、物聯網設備的傳感器記錄或無數其他示例。

It’s the raw material that will eventually be turned into an insight ready for action.
這是最終將轉化為可行見解的原材料。

Data collection brings that initial unit of data to the assembly line through ingestion.
數據收集通過攝取將初始數據單位帶到裝配線上。

The basic function of ingestion is to extract data from the system in which it’s hosted and bring it to a new system.
攝取的基本功能是從托管數據的系統中提取數據並將其帶到新系統。

It can have dramatically different requirements based on the volume, velocity, and variety of the raw data that’s required for a given analysis, and how fast the data needs to be analyzed.
根據給定分析所需的原始數據的量、速度和種類以及數據需要分析的速度，攝取的需求可能會大不相同。

Data processing is where the collected raw data is transformed into a form that’s ready to derive insights from.
數據處理是將收集到的原始數據轉換為可用於得出見解的形式的過程。

The data will likely need to be adjusted, for example, by merging different datasets together.
數據可能需要進行調整，例如將不同的數據集合併在一起。

It can be a single-stage operation, or it can be a complex tree of cascading procedures.
這可以是一個單階段操作，也可以是多個級聯程序的複雜樹。

In our manufacturing process analogy, this phase is where raw materials take the shape of the pre-assembly parts of a manufactured product.
在我們的製造過程類比中，此階段是原材料形成製成產品的預裝配部件的過程。

Data storage is where the data lands, can be found, and is ready for analysis and action.
數據存儲是數據落地、可找到並準備進行分析和操作的地方。

As with real-world manufacturing, where storage options vary depending on the type of product that is processed, different types of data can be stored in different ways.
與現實世界中的製造一樣，存儲選項根據處理的產品類型而有所不同，不同類型的數據可以以不同方式存儲。

For example, NoSQL is available for fast reads and writes, data warehousing for fast access to analysis, and object storage for unstructured data.
例如，NoSQL可用於快速讀寫，數據倉庫可用於快速訪問分析，對象存儲可用於非結構化數據。

There are also customized options of these standard stores.
這些標準存儲還有定制選項。

Data analysis provides direction for business-oriented action.
數據分析為業務導向的行動提供方向。

To continue with our manufacturing line analogy, in this stage, inputs from the data processing stage are assembled into a final product.
繼續我們的製造線類比，在此階段，來自數據處理階段的輸入被組裝成最終產品。

And finally, the last step in the data value chain is data activation.
最後，數據價值鏈中的最後一步是數據激活。

When an analysis is produced, it needs to be pushed to the relevant business procedures and decision makers so that action can be taken and the value chain completed.
當產生分析時，需要將其推送給相關業務程序和決策者，以便採取行動並完成價值鏈。

The most common points of activation are applications that make automated decisions and business intelligence dashboards that guide humans toward better, more informed decisions.
最常見的激活點是做出自動決策的應用程序和引導人們做出更好、更明智決策的業務智能儀表板。

In our manufacturing line example, this is the step where a fully produced product is put to its intended use.
在我們的製造線示例中，這是將完全製成的產品投入其預定用途的步驟。

There is no one way to assemble a data value chain, as there’s no one way to create a real-world manufacturing line.
組裝數據價值鏈沒有一種方法，就像創建現實世界的製造線沒有一種方法一樣。

Similarly, as technologies progress, new inputs become available, your workforce evolves, or the desired output changes, the optimal value chain will also change.
同樣，隨著技術的進步，新輸入變得可用，您的勞動力發展或所需輸出變化，最佳價值鏈也會發生變化。

However, at its core, the value chain principles hold.
然而，其核心是價值鏈原則。

We want to use raw data to perform actions that benefit the business.
我們希望利用原始數據來執行對業務有益的行動。

### 2.1.6 Data governance

數據治理

In the last decade, the amount of data produced has increased exponentially, and the cloud has made it easier to collect, store, and analyze it at a lower cost.
在過去的十年中，生成的數據量呈指數級增長，而雲技術使得以較低成本收集、存儲和分析數據變得更容易。

Organizations are now challenged to democratize and embed data in every decision, while they also ensure that it’s secure and protected from unauthorized use.
組織現在面臨的挑戰是使數據民主化並嵌入每個決策中，同時確保其安全並防止未經授權的使用。

An effective data governance program can help implement data directives to achieve this.
一個有效的數據治理計劃可以幫助實施數據指令來實現這一目標。

But what exactly is data governance?
但究竟什麼是數據治理？

Data governance means setting internal standards—data policies—that apply to how data is gathered, stored, processed, and disposed of.
數據治理是指設定內部標準——數據政策——適用於數據的收集、存儲、處理和處置方式。

It governs who can access certain data and what data is under governance.
它管理誰可以訪問特定數據以及哪些數據受到治理。

It also involves complying with external standards set by industry associations, government agencies, and other stakeholders.
它還涉及遵守行業協會、政府機構和其他利益相關者設定的外部標準。

Data governance focuses on making the data available to all stakeholders across the full lifecycle of the data, in a form that they can readily access and use, in a manner that generates the desired business outcomes through insights and analysis, and if relevant, in a way that conforms to regulatory standards and compliance needs.
數據治理的重點是使數據在其全生命周期內以所有利益相關者可以輕鬆訪問和使用的形式可用，以通過洞察和分析生成所需的業務結果，並在相關情況下以符合監管標準和合規需求的方式提供數據。

Data governance brings several benefits.
數據治理帶來多種好處。

It makes data more valuable.
它使數據更有價值。

Data governance implements processes to ensure high quality data, and provides a platform that makes it easier to share data securely with stakeholders across the organization.
數據治理實施過程以確保高質量數據，並提供平台，使與組織內的利益相關者安全共享數據變得更容易。

It helps users make better, more timely decisions.
它幫助用戶做出更好、更及時的決策。

Through data governance, users throughout an organization get the data they need to reach and service customers, design and improve products and services, and seize opportunities for new revenues.
通過數據治理，組織中的用戶獲取他們需要的數據以觸及和服務客戶、設計和改進產品和服務並抓住新收入的機會。

By democratizing data, organizations can embed data in all decision making.
通過數據民主化，組織可以在所有決策中嵌入數據。

It improves cost controls.
它改進了成本控制。

Data helps organizations manage resources and operate more effectively.
數據幫助組織管理資源並更有效地運營。

Because they can eliminate data duplication caused by information silos, they don’t overbuy—and have to maintain—expensive hardware.
由於他們可以消除信息孤島造成的數據重複，他們不會過度購買並且不得不維護昂貴的硬件。

It enhances regulatory compliance.
它增強了監管合規性。

An increasingly complex regulatory climate has made it even more important for organizations to establish rigorous data governance practices.
越來越複雜的監管環境使得組織建立嚴格的數據治理實踐變得更加重要。

They avoid risks associated with noncompliance and proactively anticipate new regulations.
他們避免與不合規相關的風險並積極預見新法規。

It helps earn greater trust from customers and suppliers.
它有助於贏得客戶和供應商的更大信任。

By being in auditable compliance with both internal and external data policies, organizations gain the trust of customers and partners.
通過符合可審計的內部和外部數據政策，組織贏得了客戶和合作夥伴的信任。

It helps manage risk.
它幫助管理風險。

With robust data governance, organizations can reduce concerns about exposure of sensitive data to individuals or systems who lack proper authorization, security breaches from malicious outsiders, or even insiders who access data they don’t have the right to see.
通過健全的數據治理，組織可以減少對敏感數據暴露給缺乏適當授權的個人或系統的擔憂，減少來自惡意外部人員的安全漏洞，甚至內部人員訪問他們無權查看的數據的風險。

It allows more personnel access to more data.
它允許更多人員訪問更多數據。

Strong data governance provides confidence that the right personnel get access to the right data, and that this democratization of data does not negatively impact the organization.
強有力的數據治理提供了信心，即正確的人員獲取正確的數據，並且這種數據民主化不會對組織產生負面影響。

It's possible that organizations without an effective data governance program will suffer from compliance violations.
沒有有效數據治理計劃的組織可能會遭受合規違規。

This can lead to fines, poor data quality–which generates lower quality insights that impact business decisions, challenges in finding data–which results in delayed analysis and missed business opportunities, and poorly trained data models for AI–which reduces the model accuracy and benefits of using AI.
這可能會導致罰款、數據質量差——產生影響業務決策的低質量洞察、數據查找困難——導致分析延遲和錯失業務機會，以及AI數據模型訓練不佳——降低模型精度和使用AI的效益。

Every organization needs data governance.
每個組織都需要數據治理。

As businesses throughout all industries progress on their digital transformation journeys, data has quickly become the most valuable asset they possess.
隨著各行各業的企業在數字化轉型旅程中不斷進步，數據迅速成為他們擁有的最有價值的資產。



## 2.2 Google Cloud Data Management Solutions

### 2.2.1 Unstructured data storage

非結構化數據存儲

Every application needs to store data, like media to be streamed or even sensor data from devices, and different applications and workloads require different storage solutions.
每個應用程序都需要存儲數據，例如要流式傳輸的媒體或來自設備的傳感器數據，不同的應用程序和工作負載需要不同的存儲解決方案。

Google Cloud offers several core storage products.
Google Cloud 提供幾種核心存儲產品。

This list includes Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Spanner, BigQuery, Firestore, and Bigtable.
這個列表包括 Cloud Storage、Cloud SQL、Spanner、BigQuery、Firestore 和 Bigtable。

Depending on your use case, you might use one or several of these services to do the job.
根據您的使用情況，您可能會使用其中的一種或多種服務來完成工作。

Let’s begin with Cloud Storage, which is a service that offers developers and IT organizations durable and highly available object storage.
讓我們從 Cloud Storage 開始，這是一種為開發人員和 IT 組織提供持久且高度可用的對象存儲的服務。

But what is object storage?
但什麼是對象存儲？

Object storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as “objects” instead of as file storage, which is a file and folder hierarchy, or as block storage, which is chunks of a disk.
對象存儲是一種計算機數據存儲架構，它將數據管理為“對象”，而不是作為文件存儲，即文件和文件夾層次結構，或作為塊存儲，即磁盤的塊。

These objects are stored in a packaged format that contains the binary form of the actual data, and relevant associated metadata–such as creation date, author, resource type, and permissions–and a globally unique identifier.
這些對象以包含實際數據的二進制形式的包裝格式存儲，並包含相關的元數據，例如創建日期、作者、資源類型和許可權，以及全球唯一標識符。

These unique keys are in the form of URLs, which means object storage interacts well with web technologies.
這些唯一鍵是 URL 形式，這意味著對象存儲與 Web 技術互動良好。

Data commonly stored as objects include video, pictures, and audio recordings.
通常作為對象存儲的數據包括視頻、圖片和音頻記錄。

This type of data is referred to as unstructured, which means that it doesn’t have a predefined data model or isn’t organized in a predefined manner, as you might find in a structured database format.
這類數據稱為非結構化數據，這意味著它沒有預定義的數據模型，也沒有以預定義的方式組織，就像在結構化數據庫格式中可能找到的那樣。

Cloud Storage lets customers store any amount of data and retrieve it as often as needed.
Cloud Storage 允許客戶存儲任意數量的數據，並根據需要經常檢索它。

It’s a fully managed, scalable service that has a wide variety of uses, such as serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, and distributing large data objects to end users through direct download.
這是一種完全托管的可擴展服務，具有多種用途，例如提供網站內容、存儲用於歸檔和災難恢復的數據，並通過直接下載將大數據對象分發給最終用戶。

There are four primary storage classes in Cloud Storage.
Cloud Storage 中有四種主要的存儲類別。

The first is Standard storage.
第一種是標準存儲。

Standard Storage is considered best for frequently accessed, or “hot,” data.
標準存儲被認為最適合頻繁訪問的數據，即“熱”數據。

It’s also great for data that’s stored for only brief periods of time.
它也非常適合僅存儲很短時間的數據。

The second storage class is Nearline storage.
第二種存儲類別是近線存儲。

This option is best for storing infrequently accessed data, like reading or modifying data on average once a month or less.
此選項最適合存儲不頻繁訪問的數據，例如平均每月或更少次讀取或修改數據。

Examples might include data backups, long-tail multimedia content, or data archiving.
例如可能包括數據備份、長尾多媒體內容或數據歸檔。

The third storage class is Coldline storage.
第三種存儲類別是冷線存儲。

This is also a low-cost option for storing infrequently accessed data.
這也是一種低成本選擇，用於存儲不頻繁訪問的數據。

However, as compared to Nearline storage, Coldline storage is meant for reading or modifying data, at most, once every 90 days.
然而，與近線存儲相比，冷線存儲旨在每 90 天最多讀取或修改一次數據。

And the fourth storage class is Archive storage.
第四種存儲類別是歸檔存儲。

This is the lowest-cost option, used ideally for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.
這是成本最低的選擇，理想情況下用於數據歸檔、在線備份和災難恢復。

It’s the best choice for data that you plan to access less than once a year, because it has higher costs for data access and operations and a 365-day minimum storage duration.
這是您計劃每年訪問不到一次的數據的最佳選擇，因為它的數據訪問和操作成本較高，並且最短存儲期為 365 天。

Although each of these four classes have differences, it’s worth noting there are several characteristics that apply across all of these storage classes, which include: unlimited storage with no minimum object size requirement, worldwide accessibility and locations, low latency and high durability, a uniform experience–which extends to security, tools, and APIs, and geo-redundancy if data is stored in a multi-region or dual-region.
儘管這四個類別各有不同，但值得注意的是，它們都有一些共同的特徵，包括：無限制存儲且無最小對象大小要求、全球可訪問性和位置、低延遲和高耐久性、統一體驗——擴展到安全性、工具和 API，如果數據存儲在多區域或雙區域，則具有地理冗餘性。

This means placing physical servers in geographically diverse data centers to protect against catastrophic events and natural disasters, and load-balancing traffic for optimal performance.
這意味著將物理服務器放置在地理上分散的數據中心以防止災難性事件和自然災害，並進行流量負載均衡以實現最佳性能。

Cloud Storage also provides a feature called Autoclass, which automatically transitions objects to appropriate storage classes based on each object's access pattern.
Cloud Storage 還提供一個名為 Autoclass 的功能，該功能根據每個對象的訪問模式自動將對象轉換為適當的存儲類別。

The feature moves data that is not accessed to colder storage classes to reduce storage cost and moves data that is accessed to Standard storage to optimize future accesses.
該功能將未訪問的數據移至較冷的存儲類別以降低存儲成本，並將訪問的數據移至標準存儲以優化未來的訪問。

Autoclass simplifies and automates cost saving for your Cloud Storage data.
Autoclass 簡化並自動化您的 Cloud Storage 數據的成本節省。

### 2.2.2 Structured data storage

結構化數據存儲

In the previous lesson, you saw how Cloud Storage is used to store unstructured data.
在前一課中，您看到了 Cloud Storage 如何用於存儲非結構化數據。

Now let’s explore some Google Cloud data storage products that are suited for storing structured data.
現在讓我們來探索一些適合存儲結構化數據的 Google Cloud 數據存儲產品。

Structured data consists of numbers and values that are organized in a predefined format that’s easily searchable in a relational database.
結構化數據由數字和數值組成，這些數據按預定義格式組織，在關係數據庫中易於搜索。

Earlier in the course, we mentioned that a relational database stores information in tables, rows, and columns that have a clearly defined schema that represents the structure or logical configuration of the database.
在課程的早期，我們提到關係數據庫將信息存儲在表、行和列中，這些表、行和列具有明確定義的模式，表示數據庫的結構或邏輯配置。

Cloud SQL offers fully managed relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server as a service.
Cloud SQL 提供完全托管的關係數據庫，包括 MySQL、PostgreSQL 和 SQL Server 作為服務。

It’s designed to transfer mundane—but necessary and often time-consuming—tasks to Google, like applying patches and updates, managing backups, and configuring replications, so you can focus on building great applications.
它旨在將平凡但必要且通常耗時的任務轉移到 Google，比如應用補丁和更新、管理備份和配置複製，這樣您就可以專注於構建出色的應用程序。

Trusted by thousands of the largest enterprises around the world, organizations that use Cloud SQL obtain various benefits.
全球數千家大型企業信賴，使用 Cloud SQL 的組織獲得了各種好處。

It doesn't require any software installation or maintenance.
它不需要任何軟件安裝或維護。

It supports managed backups, so backed-up data is securely stored and accessible if a restore is required.
它支持托管備份，因此備份的數據安全存儲並且如果需要恢復可以訪問。

It encrypts customer data when on Google’s internal networks and when stored in database tables, temporary files, and backups.
在 Google 的內部網絡上以及存儲在數據庫表、臨時文件和備份中時，它會加密客戶數據。

And it includes a network firewall, which controls network access to each database instance.
它還包括一個網絡防火牆，控制每個數據庫實例的網絡訪問。

Spanner is a fully managed, mission-critical, relational database service that scales horizontally to handle unexpected business spikes.
Spanner 是一種完全托管的、關鍵任務的關係數據庫服務，可以水平擴展以應對意外的業務激增。

Battle tested by Google’s own mission-critical applications and services, Spanner is the service that powers Google’s multi-billion dollar business.
經過 Google 自身關鍵任務應用和服務的實戰檢驗，Spanner 是支持 Google 數十億美元業務的服務。

Spanner is especially suited for applications that require a SQL relational database management system with joins and secondary indexes, built-in high availability,
Spanner 特別適合需要帶有聯接和次級索引的 SQL 關係數據庫管理系統、內置高可用性的應用程序，

which provides data redundancy to reduce downtime when a zone or instance becomes unavailable (the goal is to prevent a single point of failure), strong global consistency, which ensures that all locations where data is stored are updated to the most recent data version quickly, and high numbers of input and output operations per second (tens of thousands of reads and writes per second or more).
提供數據冗餘以減少區域或實例不可用時的停機時間（目標是防止單點故障）、強大的全球一致性，確保存儲數據的所有位置快速更新到最新數據版本，以及每秒大量的輸入和輸出操作（每秒數萬次讀寫或更多）。

Both Cloud SQL and Spanner are fully managed database services, but how do they differ?
Cloud SQL 和 Spanner 都是完全托管的數據庫服務，但它們有何不同？

Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server with greater than 99.95% availability.
Cloud SQL 是一種為 MySQL、PostgreSQL 和 SQL Server 提供完全托管的關係數據庫服務，可用性超過 99.95%。

Database Migration Service (DMS) makes it easy to migrate your production databases to Cloud SQL with minimal downtime.
數據庫遷移服務 (DMS) 使您可以輕鬆地將生產數據庫遷移到 Cloud SQL，並且停機時間最少。

And then there is Spanner, which is a fully managed relational database with unlimited scale, strong consistency, and up to 99.999% availability with zero downtime for planned maintenance and schema changes.
然後是 Spanner，它是一種完全托管的關係數據庫，具有無限擴展性、強一致性和高達 99.999% 的可用性，計劃維護和架構更改的停機時間為零。

This globally distributed, ACID-compliant cloud database automatically handles replicas, sharding, and transaction processing, so you can quickly scale to meet any usage pattern and ensure success of products.
這個全球分佈、符合 ACID 的雲數據庫自動處理副本、分片和交易處理，因此您可以快速擴展以滿足任何使用模式並確保產品的成功。

When considering which option is best for your business, consider this: if you have outgrown any relational database, are sharding your databases for throughput high performance, need transactional consistency, global data, and strong consistency, or just want to consolidate your database, consider using Spanner.
在考慮哪種選擇最適合您的業務時，請考慮以下幾點：如果您已經超出了任何關係數據庫的能力，正在對數據庫進行分片以提高吞吐量和高性能，需要事務一致性、全球數據和強一致性，或者只是想整合您的數據庫，請考慮使用 Spanner。

If you don’t need horizontal scaling or a globally available system, Cloud SQL is a cost-effective solution.
如果您不需要水平擴展或全球可用的系統，Cloud SQL 是一種具有成本效益的解決方案。

The final structured data storage solution that we’ll explore is BigQuery.
我們將探索的最後一個結構化數據存儲解決方案是 BigQuery。

BigQuery is a fully-managed data warehouse.
BigQuery 是一個完全托管的數據倉庫。

As we’ve already learned, a data warehouse is a large store that contains petabytes of data gathered from a wide range of sources within an organization and is used to guide management decisions.
如我們已經了解到的，數據倉庫是一個大型存儲，包含從組織內的各種來源收集的數 PB 數據，用於指導管理決策。

Because it’s fully managed, BigQuery takes care of the underlying infrastructure, so users can focus on using SQL queries to answer business questions, without having to worry about deployment, scalability, and security.
由於它是完全托管的，BigQuery 負責底層基礎設施，因此用戶可以專注於使用 SQL 查詢回答業務問題，而不必擔心部署、可擴展性和安全性。

BigQuery provides two services in one: storage and analytics.
BigQuery 提供兩項服務：存儲和分析。

It’s a place to store petabytes of data.
這是一個存儲數 PB 數據的地方。

For reference, one petabyte is equivalent to 11,000 movies at 4k quality.
作為參考，一個 PB 相當於 11,000 部 4k 質量的電影。

BigQuery is also a place to analyze data, with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.
BigQuery 也是一個分析數據的地方，具有內置功能，如機器學習、地理空間分析和商業智能。

Data in BigQuery is encrypted at rest by default without any action required from a user.
BigQuery 中的數據默認靜態加密，無需用戶執行任何操作。

Encryption at rest is encryption used to protect data that’s stored on a disk, including solid-state drives, or backup media.
靜態加密是用於保護存儲在磁盤上的數據的加密，包括固態硬盤或備份媒介。

BigQuery provides seamless integration with the existing partner ecosystem.
BigQuery 與現有的合作夥伴生態系統無縫集成。

Businesses can tap into our ecosystem of system integrators and data integration partners to help enhance analytics and reporting.
企業可以利用我們的系統集成商和數據集成合作夥伴的生態系統來幫助增強分析和報告。

These integrations mean that BigQuery lets organizations make the most of existing investments in business intelligence, data ingestion, and data integration tools.
這些集成意味著 BigQuery 允許組織充分利用在商業智能、數據攝取和數據集成工具方面的現有投資。

Industry research shows that 90% of organizations have a multicloud strategy, which adds complexity to data integration, orchestration, and governance.
行業研究表明，90% 的組織擁有多雲戰略，這增加了數據集成、協作和治理的複雜性。

BigQuery works in a multicloud environment, which lets data teams eradicate data silos by using BigQuery to securely and cost effectively analyze data across multiple cloud providers.
BigQuery 在多雲環境中工作，數據團隊可以使用 BigQuery 來安全且具有成本效益地跨多個雲提供商分析數據，從而消除數據孤島。

BigQuery also has built-in machine learning features so that ML models can be written directly in BigQuery by using SQL.
BigQuery 還具有內置機器學習功能，因此可以使用 SQL 直接在 BigQuery 中編寫 ML 模型。

And if other professional tools—such as Vertex AI from Google Cloud—are used to train ML models, datasets
can be exported from BigQuery directly into Vertex AI for a seamless integration across the data-to-AI lifecycle.
如果使用其他專業工具（例如來自 Google Cloud 的 Vertex AI）來訓練 ML 模型，數據集可以從 BigQuery 直接導出到 Vertex AI，以實現數據到 AI 生命週期的無縫集成。


### 2.2.3 Semi-structured data storage

Semi-structured data contains elements of both structured and unstructured data.
It does have some defining or consistent characteristics, but generally doesn’t follow a structure as rigid as a relational database.
Semi-structured data is easier to organize because it usually contains some organizational properties, such as tags or metadata.
An example of unstructured data is an email message.
While the actual content of the email is unstructured, it does contain structured data such as
the name and email address of the sender and recipient, the time sent, and so on.
Google Cloud offers two semi-structured data storage products, Firestore and Bigtable.
Firestore is a flexible, horizontally scalable, NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing data in real-time.
Firestore can be directly accessed by mobile and web applications.
Firestore performs data storage in the form of documents, with the documents being stored in collections.
Documents support a wide variety of data types, such as nested objects, numbers, and strings.
One of Firestore’s main features is automatic scaling.
It’s been designed to scale automatically depending on user demand, but retains the same level of performance irrespective of database size.
Firestore also provides offline usage through a comprehensive database on users’ devices.
Offline data access ensures that applications run without interruption, even if the user gets disconnected from the internet.
And then there’s Bigtable, Google's NoSQL big data database service.
It's the same database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.
Bigtable is designed to handle large workloads at consistent low latency, which means Bigtable responds to requests quickly, and high throughput, which means it can send and receive large amounts of data.
For this reason, it's a great choice for both operational and analytical applications, including Internet of Things, user analytics, and financial data analysis.
When deciding on a storage option, you might choose Bigtable if you’re working with more than 1TB of semi-structured or structured data, data is fast with high throughput, or it’s rapidly changing, you’re working with NoSQL data, data is a time-series or has natural ordering, you’re working with big data and running batch or real-time processing on the data, or you’re running machine learning algorithms on the data.

### 2.2.4 Choosing the right storage product

So, you’ve learned about the different storage options that Google Cloud offers, but in what scenarios should you use each one?
Ultimately, it’s a combination of the data type that needs to be stored and the business need.
If data is unstructured, then Cloud Storage is the most appropriate option.
You have to decide a storage class: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, or Archive.
Or whether to let the Autoclass feature decide that for you.
If data is structured or semi-structured, choosing a storage product will depend on whether workloads are transactional or analytical.
Transactional workloads stem from online transaction processing, or OLTP, systems, which are used when fast data inserts and updates are required to build row-based records.
An example of this is point-of-sale transaction records.
Then there are analytical workloads, which stem from online analytical processing, or OLAP systems, which are used when entire datasets need to be read.
They often require complex queries, for example, aggregations.
An example here would be analyzing sales history to see trends and aggregated views.
After you determine if the workloads are transactional or analytical, you must determine whether the data will be accessed by using SQL.
So, if your data is transactional and you need to access it by using SQL, then Cloud SQL and Spanner are two options.
Cloud SQL works best for local to regional scalability, and Spanner is best to scale a database globally.
If the transactional data will be accessed without SQL, Firestore might be the best option.
Firestore is a transactional NoSQL, document-oriented database.
If you have analytical workloads that require SQL commands, BigQuery might be the best option.
BigQuery, Google’s data warehouse solution, lets you analyze petabyte-scale datasets.
Alternatively, Bigtable provides a scalable NoSQL solution for analytical workloads.
It’s best for real-time, high-throughput applications that require only millisecond latency.

### 2.2.5 Database migration and modernization

Running modern applications on legacy, on-premises databases requires overcoming expensive, time-consuming challenges around latency, throughput, availability, and scaling. With database modernization, organizations can move data from traditional databases to fully managed or modern databases with relative ease.
There are different ways that an organization can migrate or modernize their current database in the cloud.
The most straightforward method is a lift and shift platform migration.
This is where databases are migrated from on-premises and private cloud environments to the same type of database hosted by a public cloud provider, such as Google Cloud.
Although this solution makes the database more difficult to modernize, it does bring with it the benefits of minimal upheaval, and having data and infrastructure managed by the cloud provider.
Alternatively, a managed database migration allows the migration of databases from SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others to a fully managed Google Cloud database.
Although this migration requires careful planning and might cause slight upheaval, a fully managed solution lets you focus on higher priority work that really adds value to your organization.
Google Cloud’s Database Migration Service (DMS) can easily migrate your databases to Google Cloud, or Datastream can be used to synchronize data across databases, storage systems, and applications.
Let’s look at a real life use case.
With 18 fulfillment centers, 38 delivery centers, and a catalog of more than 22 million items, the online retailer
Wayfair needed a way to quickly move from their on-premises data centers, which ran on SQL Server, to Google Cloud.
This had to be achieved without inconveniencing their team of over 3,000 engineers, their tens of millions of customers, or their 16,000 supplier partners.
So, the goal was to lift and shift their workloads as quickly as possible with minimal changes, and then use cloud databases to modernize those workloads.
Wayfair chose Google Cloud because of the clear path for shifting workloads to the cloud by using Cloud SQL for SQL Server.
Google Cloud provided the flexibility to be deliberate about which engine and product to run Wayfair’s systems on going forward.
They liked how they could run SQL Server on virtual machines (VMs), for example, but could also benefit from database offerings like Cloud SQL and Spanner.
Now that migration is complete, they also use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Compute Engine VMs to host the services built by the Google Cloud team.
They also use Pub/Sub and Dataflow for sending operational data to their analytical store in BigQuery.

## 2.3 Making Data Useful and Accessible

### 2.3.1 Business intelligence and insights using Looker

When data is in a database, a fair amount of effort and expertise might still be required to uncover insights.
This goal can be achieved by using a business intelligence solution.
However, the challenge that organizations often face is identifying the right business intelligence solution.
Some solutions are too complex and not accessible by those outside the data engineering or data analysis teams.
This means other teams have to put in requests and wait for answers, which defeats the purpose of gaining real-time insights.
Other solutions let everyone in the business perform their own data analysis, but they can only perform their analysis with a selection of the available data.
This means that only a few people, or possibly no one, has a full view of the organization’s business data.
Looker is a Google Cloud business intelligence (BI) platform designed to help individuals and teams analyze, visualize, and share data.
This includes creating interactive dashboards and reports that are easy to understand and share.
By having a reliable authority for business data, anyone on a team can explore it, ask and answer their own questions, and create visualizations.
This approach empowers organizations to not just uncover insights but also act on them.
Looker supports BigQuery, along with more than 60 different SQL databases.
Together, BigQuery and Looker provide rich, interactive dashboards and reports without compromising performance, scale, security, or data freshness.
Looker is also 100% web-based, which makes it easy to integrate into existing workflows and share with multiple teams at an organization.
So how can Looker be used?
Let's explore an example.
Diamond Resorts, a global leader in hospitality, offers destinations, events, and experiences to help people recharge, connect, and enjoy.
They had previously used a mixture of complex Excel workbooks and legacy BI tools to track important metrics.
Each business unit operated and ran their own siloed data initiatives.
As a result, there were: No common view of business or single authority for common metrics Redundant data engineering efforts, because work was never shared or used across the organization
And inconsistent project prioritization, because decisions were driven primarily on intuition as opposed to actual
data Also, infrastructure did not meet business requirements with: Executive reporting efforts that took months to complete Data that was duplicated across multiple business units without proper governance Multiple reporting tools and data warehouses throughout the business And infrastructure that didn’t support advanced analytics aspirations Diamond Resorts wanted to create a single common cloud-based architecture that was fully-managed; establishing data governance and enabling the business to be more data-driven, while they set the foundation for advanced analytics efforts.
They migrated to the cloud and began using Looker to help improve business agility.
This decision let them gain access to real-time insights in less than 3 months.
It helped them to navigate COVID changes with important operational metrics such as daily booking and cancellations, while it also provided a 360-degree customer view.
And in addition to this, manual reporting for the Yield Management team was decreased by hours each day.
The chief information officer said, “Projects that we anticipated coming in future years were suddenly ready to be tackled within weeks.”
This is just one example of how an effective business intelligence solution can let businesses transform to better serve their customers.

### 2.3.2 Streaming analytics

Data traditionally is moved in batches.
Batch processing often processes large volumes of data at the same time, with long periods of latency.
An example is payroll and billing systems that have to be processed on either a weekly or monthly basis.
Although this approach can be efficient to handle large volumes of data, it doesn’t work with time-sensitive
data that’s meant to be streamed, because that data can be stale by the time it’s processed.
Streaming analytics is the processing and analyzing of data records continuously instead of in batches.
Generally, streaming analytics is useful for the types of data sources that send data in small sizes, often in kilobytes, in a continuous flow as the data is generated.
This results in the analysis and reporting of events as they happen.
Sources of streaming data include equipment sensors, clickstreams, social media feeds, stock market quotes, app activity, and more.
Companies use streaming analytics to analyze data in real time and provide insights into a wide range of activities, such as metering, server activity, geolocation of devices, or website clicks.
Use cases include: Ecommerce: User clickstreams can be analyzed to optimize the shopping experience with real-time pricing, promotions, and inventory management.
Financial services: Account activity can be analyzed to detect abnormal behavior in the data stream and generate a security alert.
Investment services: Market changes can be tracked and settings adjusted to customer portfolios based on configured constraints, such as selling when a certain stock value is reached.
News media: User click records can be streamed from various news source platforms and the data can
then be enriched with demographic information to better serve articles that are relevant to the targeted audience.
Utilities: Throughput across a power grid can be monitored and alerts generated or workflows initiated when established thresholds are reached.
Google Cloud offers two main streaming analytics products to ingest, process, and analyze event streams in real time, which makes data more useful and accessible from the instant it’s generated.
Pub/Sub ingests hundreds of millions of events per second, but Dataflow unifies streaming and batch data analysis and builds cohesive data pipelines.
A data pipeline represents a series of actions, or stages, that ingest raw data from different sources and then move that data to a destination for storage and analysis.
You'll explore these products in more detail in the next section.


### 2.3.2 Pub/Sub and Dataflow

One of the early stages in a data pipeline is data ingestion, which is where large amounts of streaming data are received.
Data, however, may not always come from a single, structured database.
Instead, the data might stream from a thousand, or even a million, different events that are all happening asynchronously.
A common example of this is data from IoT, or Internet of Things, applications.
These can include sensors on taxis that send out location data every 30 seconds or temperature sensors around a data center to help optimize heating and cooling.
Pub/Sub is a distributed messaging service that can receive messages from various device streams such as gaming events, IoT devices, and application streams.
The name is short for Publisher/Subscriber, or publish messages to subscribers.
After messages have been captured from the streaming input sources you need a way to pipe that data into a data warehouse for analysis.
This is where Dataflow comes in.
Dataflow creates a pipeline to process both streaming data and batch data.
"Process" in this case refers to the steps to extract, transform, and load data, sometimes referred to as ETL.
A popular solution for pipeline design is Apache Beam.
It’s an open source, unified programming model to define and execute data processing pipelines, including ETL, batch, and stream processing.
Dataflow handles much of the complexity for infrastructure setup and maintenance, and is built on Google’s infrastructure.
This product allows for reliable auto scaling to meet data pipeline demands.
Dataflow is serverless and fully managed.
Serverless computing means that software developers can build and run applications without having to provision or manage the back-end infrastructure.
For example, Google Cloud manages infrastructure tasks on behalf of the users, like resource provisioning, performance tuning, and ensuring pipeline reliability.
And a fully managed environment is one where software can be deployed, monitored, and managed without needing an operations team.
You can create this environment by using automation tools and technologies.
Using a serverless and fully managed solution like Dataflow means that you can spend more time analyzing the insights from your datasets and less time provisioning resources to ensure that your pipeline will successfully complete its next cycles.

## 2.4 Course Summary

This brings us to the end of the Exploring Data Transformation with Google Cloud course.
Let’s do a quick recap.
In the first section of the course, The Value of Data, you learned how data generates business insights and drives decision making; basic data management concepts, like databases, data warehouses, and data lakes; how organizations can create value by using their current data, collecting new data, and sourcing data externally; how the cloud unlocks business value from all types of data, including structured data and previously untapped unstructured data; about the data value chain, from the initial creation of data to data activation; and the importance that data governance plays in a successful data journey.
In the second section of the course, Google Cloud Data Management Solutions, you learned about
Google Cloud data management options and the differences between them; about the different storage classes available with Cloud Storage; how to choose the right storage product to meet the needs of
your organization; and ways an organization can migrate and/or modernize their current database in the cloud.
Finally, in the third section of the course, Making Data Useful and Accessible, you learned how Looker makes it easy for a workforce to access the data they need, when they need it; how streaming analytics in real time can make data more useful; and about two Google Cloud products that modernize data pipelines, Pub/Sub and Dataflow.
Now that you’ve had a comprehensive introduction to data transformation, move on to the next course in the series, Innovating with Google Cloud Artificial Intelligence,
