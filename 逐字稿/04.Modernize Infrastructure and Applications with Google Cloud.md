## 4.1 Modernizing Infrastructure in the Cloud

### 4.1.1 The benefits of running compute workloads in the cloud

The benefits of running compute workloads in the cloud

在雲端運行計算工作負載的好處

Why should an organization consider running compute workloads in the Cloud?
為什麼組織應該考慮在雲端運行計算工作負載？

Let's explore some benefits that running compute workloads in the Cloud can bring to an organization.
讓我們探討在雲端運行計算工作負載能為組織帶來的一些好處。

We'll begin with total cost of ownership, or TCO, which is a measure of the total cost of a system or solution over its lifetime.
我們將從總擁有成本（TCO）開始，這是衡量一個系統或解決方案在其生命周期內的總成本。

It includes the cost of the initial purchase, maintenance and operation, along with any other associated costs.
它包括初始購買成本、維護和運營成本以及任何其他相關成本。

Cloud computing can help businesses save money on IT costs by eliminating the need to purchase and maintain physical infrastructure.
雲計算可以幫助企業節省 IT 成本，因為它消除了購買和維護物理基礎設施的需求。

Cloud providers offer a pay-as-you-go model, which means that organizations only pay for the resources used.
雲提供商提供按需付費模式，這意味著組織只需為所使用的資源付費。

They also offer discounts for long term commitments, which can further reduce TCO for businesses that are planning to use Cloud services for a long period.
他們還為長期承諾提供折扣，這可以進一步降低計劃長期使用雲服務的企業的 TCO。

Next, there is scalability, which refers to the ability to increase or decrease the number of resources such as servers, storage, and bandwidth that are available to a Cloud-based application to meet changing demand.
接下來是可擴展性，這是指能夠根據需求變化增加或減少雲端應用程序可用的資源數量，如服務器、存儲和帶寬。

Scalability is important because it provides a means to meet changing demand without having to make large upfront investments in infrastructure.
可擴展性很重要，因為它提供了一種在不需要進行大量前期基礎設施投資的情況下滿足需求變化的方法。

If a business experiences a sudden spike in demand, it can easily scale up its Cloud resources to meet the demand.
如果企業經歷需求的突然激增，它可以輕鬆擴展其雲端資源以滿足需求。

Conversely, if they experience reduced demand, infrastructure can quickly scale down its Cloud resources to save money.
相反，如果需求減少，基礎設施可以快速縮減其雲端資源以節省成本。

Another benefit to Cloud computing is reliability.
雲計算的另一個好處是可靠性。

Cloud providers offer a high degree of reliability and up-time, which gives businesses confidence that their data and applications will be available when they need them.
雲提供商提供高度的可靠性和正常運行時間，這讓企業有信心在需要時能夠使用其數據和應用程序。

Cloud providers have many ways to ensure the reliability of their services.
雲提供商有多種方法來確保其服務的可靠性。

Google Cloud for example has multiple data centers located in different parts of the world.
例如，Google Cloud 在世界各地設有多個數據中心。

This helps to ensure that if one data center goes down, the others can continue to operate.
這有助於確保如果一個數據中心宕機，其他數據中心仍能繼續運行。

Cloud providers also use various technologies to monitor their services and automatically detect and fix problems.
雲提供商還使用各種技術來監控其服務並自動檢測和修復問題。

Next is security.
接下來是安全性。

Cloud computing providers offer a high level of security for data and applications.
雲計算提供商為數據和應用程序提供高度的安全性。

Organizations need to be sure that their data is being kept safe.
組織需要確保其數據安全。

In addition to physical data center security, Cloud security features include data encryption, identity and access management, network security, virtual private Clouds, and monitoring services that can detect and respond to security threats in real time.
除了物理數據中心的安全性外，雲安全功能還包括數據加密、身份和訪問管理、網絡安全、虛擬私有雲和能夠實時檢測和應對安全威脅的監控服務。

These security features can also help to ensure compliance with government or industry regulations.
這些安全功能還可以幫助確保符合政府或行業法規。

Running compute workloads in the Cloud offers a high degree of flexibility for organizations.
在雲端運行計算工作負載為組織提供了高度的靈活性。

Organizations can choose the Cloud services that best meet their needs at any point in time, and then change or adapt those services when necessary.
組織可以在任何時候選擇最能滿足其需求的雲服務，並在需要時更改或調整這些服務。

For example, a business that needs to increase the amount of storage space that it uses can easily add more storage space to its Cloud storage service.
例如，需要增加使用存儲空間的企業可以輕鬆地將更多的存儲空間添加到其雲存儲服務中。

Finally, another benefit of running compute workloads in the Cloud is abstraction.
最後，在雲端運行計算工作負載的另一個好處是抽象化。

Abstraction refers to how Cloud providers remove the need for customers to understand the finer details of the infrastructure implementation by providing management of the hardware, software, and certain aspects of security and networking.
抽象化是指雲提供商通過提供硬件、軟件和某些安全和網絡方面的管理，消除了客戶了解基礎設施實施細節的需求。

For example, a Cloud storage provider might provide a way for customers to store files so that they don't have to worry about the finer details of how the files are stored on the Cloud providers' infrastructure.
例如，雲存儲提供商可能會提供一種方式讓客戶存儲文件，這樣他們就不必擔心文件如何存儲在雲提供商的基礎設施上的細節。

Abstraction also lets Cloud providers offer many services.
抽象化還使雲提供商能夠提供多種服務。

For example, Google Workspace lets customers run productivity applications so that they don't have to worry about the details of how the applications are actually run or maintained on Google's infrastructure.
例如，Google Workspace 允許客戶運行生產力應用程序，這樣他們就不必擔心應用程序在 Google 基礎設施上實際運行或維護的細節。

Running compute workloads in the Cloud can help organizations get their products and services to market faster by eliminating the need to develop and maintain their own infrastructure.
在雲端運行計算工作負載可以幫助組織通過消除開發和維護自有基礎設施的需求，更快地將其產品和服務推向市場。

At the same time, it provides a platform for innovation by providing access to the latest technologies and tools as and when they are released.
同時，它通過在技術和工具發布時提供訪問權限，為創新提供了一個平台。

### 4.1.2 Virtual machines

Traditionally, various technological pressures compelled many organizations to tightly bind specific computing hardware resources to specific applications.
Virtualization, technology relieved these pressures.
Virtualization is a form of resource optimization that lets multiple systems run on the same hardware.
These systems are called Virtual Machines or VMs.
This means that they share the same pool of processing, storage, and networking resources.
VMs enable organizations to run multiple applications at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and manageable.
Compute engine is Google Cloud's infrastructure as a service product, that lets users create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
There are no upfront investments, and thousands of virtual CPUs can run on a system that's designed to be fast and to offer consistent performance.
Each virtual machine contains the power and functionality of a full fledged operating system.
This means a virtual machine can be configured much like a physical server by specifying the amount of CPU power and memory needed, the amount and type of storage needed, and the operating system.
A virtual machine instance can be created through the Google Cloud Console, which is a web based tool to manage Google Cloud
projects, resources and Google Cloud CLI command line interface by using infrastructure automation tools such as Terraform or the Compute Engine API.
An API or application programming interface, is a set of instructions that allows different software programs to communicate with each other.
We'll learn about API's in more detail later in this course.
When you use virtual machines, compute engine bills by the second with a one minute minimum and sustained use discounts start to apply automatically to virtual machines the longer they run, for each VM that runs for more than 25% of a month.
Compute engine automatically applies a discount for every incremental hour of use.
Compute engine also offers committed use discounts.
This means that when committing to use resources for either a one year or three year period, discounts are offered over the on demand prices and then there are preemptable and spot VMs.
Let's say that a workload doesn't require a human to sit and wait for it to finish, such as a batch job analyzing a large dataset.
Costs can be reduced in some cases by up to 90% by choosing preemptable or spot VMs to run the job.
A preemptable or spot VM is different from an ordinary compute engine VM in only one respect.
Compute engine has permission to terminate a VM if its resources are needed elsewhere.
Although savings are possible with preemptable or spot VMs, it needs to be ensured that a job can be stopped and restarted without impact.
Spot VMs differ from preemptible VMs by offering more features.
For example, preemptable VMs can only run for up to 24 hours at a time, but spot VMs don't have a maximum run time.
However, the pricing is currently the same for both.
Finally, Compute Engine lets users choose the machine properties of their instances, like the number of virtual CPUs, the operating system, and the amount of memory by using a set of predefined machine types, or by creating custom machine types.

### 4.1.3 Containers

Infrastructure as a service, or IS, lets users share compute resources with other developers by using virtual machines to virtualize the hardware.
基礎設施即服務（IaaS）允許用戶通過使用虛擬機器來虛擬化硬件，從而與其他開發者共享計算資源。

This lets each developer deploy their own operating system, access the hardware, and build their applications in a self-contained environment with access to the necessary system resources.
這使每個開發者都能部署自己的操作系統，訪問硬件，並在一個自包含的環境中構建應用程序，使用必要的系統資源。

Containers follow the same principle as virtual machines.
容器遵循與虛擬機器相同的原則。

They provide isolated environments to run software services and optimize resources from one piece of hardware.
它們提供隔離的環境來運行軟件服務並優化來自一個硬件的資源。

However, they're even more efficient.
然而，它們更加高效。

The key difference between virtual machines and containers is that virtual machines virtualize an entire machine down to the hardware layers.
虛擬機器和容器之間的主要區別在於，虛擬機器將整個機器虛擬化到硬件層。

Whereas containers only virtualize software layers above the operating system level.
而容器僅虛擬化操作系統層之上的軟件層。

Containers start faster and use a fraction of the memory compared to booting an entire operating system.
容器啟動速度更快，並且與啟動整個操作系統相比，使用的內存僅為其一小部分。

A container is packaged with your application and all of its dependencies, so it has everything it needs to run.
容器打包了您的應用程序及其所有依賴項，因此它擁有運行所需的一切。

Containers can be independently developed, tested, and deployed, and are well suited for a microservices based architecture.
容器可以獨立開發、測試和部署，非常適合基於微服務的架構。

This architecture is made up of smaller individual services that run containerized applications, that communicate with each other through APIs or other lightweight communication methods, such as REST or gRPC.
這種架構由運行容器化應用程序的較小的獨立服務組成，這些應用程序通過 API 或其他輕量級通信方法（如 REST 或 gRPC）進行通信。

Containers let developers create predictable environments isolated from other system resources.
容器讓開發者可以創建與其他系統資源隔離的可預測環境。

So if a customer asks for a new feature or a change in the application, developers can easily make an update to that particular part of the application without affecting the REST.
因此，如果客戶要求添加新功能或更改應用程序，開發者可以輕鬆更新應用程序的特定部分而不影響其他部分。

Containers can run virtually and anywhere, which makes development and deployment easy.
容器幾乎可以在任何地方運行，這使得開發和部署變得簡單。

### 4.1.4 Managing containers

Containers improve agility, enhance security, optimize resources and simplify managing applications in the cloud.
容器提高敏捷性、增強安全性、優化資源並簡化雲端應用程式管理。
Many organizations have a mix of virtual machines and containers.
許多組織同時使用虛擬機和容器。
However, as their It infrastructure setup becomes more complex, they often need a way to manage their services and machines.
然而，隨著其 IT 基礎設施設置變得更加複雜，他們通常需要一種方法來管理他們的服務和機器。
For example, an organization can have millions and millions of containers.
例如，一個組織可能擁有數百萬個容器。
This require as keeping them secure and ensuring that they operate efficiently can require significant oversight and management.
這需要保持它們的安全性並確保它們高效運作，可能需要大量的監督和管理。
Kubernetes, originally developed by Google, is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services.
Kubernetes 最初由 Google 開發，是一個用於管理容器化工作負載和服務的開源平台。
It makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them, and easily deploy rollouts and rollbacks.
它使在多個主機上協調多個容器、擴展它們以及輕鬆部署推出和回滾變得容易。
This improves application reliability and reduces the time and resources needed to spend on management and operations.
這提高了應用程式的可靠性，並減少了在管理和運營上所需花費的時間和資源。
Google Kubernetes Engine or GKE is a Google hosted, managed Kubernetes service in the Cloud.
Google Kubernetes Engine 或 GKE 是 Google 在雲端托管的、受管理的 Kubernetes 服務。
The GKE environment consists of multiple machines, specifically compute engine instances grouped to form a cluster.
GKE 環境由多台機器組成，特別是計算引擎實例分組形成集群。
GKE clusters can be customized, and they support different machine types, numbers of nodes, and network settings.
GKE 集群可以定制，它們支持不同的機器類型、節點數量和網絡設置。
GKE makes it easy to deploy applications by providing an API and a Web based console.
GKE 通過提供 API 和基於 Web 的控制台，使部署應用程式變得容易。
Applications can be deployed in minutes and can be scaled up or down as needed.
應用程式可以在幾分鐘內部署，並可以根據需要進行擴展或縮減。
GKE also provides many features that can help monitor applications, manage resources, and troubleshoot problems.
GKE 還提供許多功能，可以幫助監控應用程式、管理資源和排除故障。
Let's explore how Ubie, a Japan based healthcare technology startup, reduced their infrastructure costs and maintenance requirements with Google Kubernetes Engine.
讓我們探討一下 Ubie，一家日本的醫療保健科技初創公司，如何通過 Google Kubernetes Engine 降低了他們的基礎設施成本和維護需求。
Founded in 2017, Ubie's goal is to get people the right medical care when they need it, and it does this with products designed for hospitals and individuals.
成立於 2017 年，Ubie 的目標是在人們需要時為他們提供適當的醫療保健，它通過為醫院和個人設計的產品來實現這一目標。
Ubie for hospital, their flagship product, is AI powered questionnaire software that lets patients provide medical details before an appointment.
Ubie for Hospital，他們的旗艦產品，是一款由人工智能驅動的問卷軟件，可讓患者在預約前提供醫療詳情。
Ubie initially relied on an alternative, Cloud, to make Ubie for Hospital available in Japan.
Ubie 最初依賴於另一種雲服務，以在日本提供 Ubie for Hospital。
As the business added new customers, they needed an infrastructure that could support daily deployments and provide a secure gateway to connect Ubie to a wide range of customer networks and settings.
隨著業務增加新客戶，他們需要一個能夠支持每日部署並提供安全網關的基礎設施，以將 Ubie 連接到各種客戶網絡和設置。
Ubie evaluated available options and decided to use Kubernetes in Google Kubernetes Engine.
Ubie 評估了可用選項，並決定在 Google Kubernetes Engine 中使用 Kubernetes。
Google Kubernetes Engine Autopilot, a mode that enables full management of an entire cluster's infrastructure and provides per-pod billing, presented a compelling option for the business to run Ubie for Hospital more efficiently and cost effectively.
Google Kubernetes Engine Autopilot 是一種能夠全面管理整個集群基礎設施並提供按 Pod 計費的模式，為企業提供了更高效、更具成本效益地運行 Ubie for Hospital 的引人注目的選擇。
With GKE Autopilot, Ubie could eliminate the need to configure and monitor clusters while only paying for running pods.
使用 GKE Autopilot，Ubie 可以消除配置和監控集群的需求，同時只需為運行中的 Pod 付費。
The shift reduced Ubie's infrastructure costs by 20%, and GKE Autopilot has helped the business eliminate
這一轉變將 Ubie 的基礎設施成本降低了 20%，GKE Autopilot 幫助企業消除了
Ubie for Hospital infrastructure maintenance and upgrade tasks that could take hours and days to complete.
Ubie for Hospital 的基礎設施維護和升級任務，這些任務可能需要數小時甚至數天才能完成。
Another popular option for running containerized applications on Google Cloud is Cloud Run.
在 Google Cloud 上運行容器化應用程序的另一個受歡迎的選擇是 Cloud Run。
Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform to deploy and run containerized applications without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
Cloud Run 是一個完全管理的無服務器平台，用於部署和運行容器化應用程序，無需擔心底層基礎設施。
After your application code is containerized and deployed to Cloud Run, Google Cloud takes care of scaling and managing the infrastructure automatically.
在你的應用程序代碼容器化並部署到 Cloud Run 後，Google Cloud 會自動處理基礎設施的擴展和管理。
Cloud Run is ideal for running stateless applications that need to scale up and down quickly in response to traffic.
Cloud Run 非常適合運行需要根據流量快速擴展和縮減的無狀態應用程序。
This makes cloud run most suitable for simple and lightweight applications such as web applications.
這使得 Cloud Run 最適合簡單和輕量級的應用程序，如 Web 應用程序。
In summary, GKE is ideal when lots of control is required over a Kubernetes Environment and there are complex applications to run.
總之，當需要對 Kubernetes 環境進行大量控制並運行複雜應用程序時，GKE 是理想的選擇。
Alternatively, Cloud Run is ideal for when a simple, fully managed serverless platform that can scale up and down quickly is required.
另一方面，當需要一個簡單的、完全管理的、可以快速擴展和縮減的無服務器平台時，Cloud Run 是理想的選擇。

### 4.1.5 Serverless computing

Another option for modernizing Cloud applications is serverless computing.
另一個現代化雲端應用程式的選擇是無伺服器運算。

Serverless computing doesn't mean there's no server, it means that resources like compute power are automatically provisioned in the background as needed.
無伺服器運算並不意味著沒有伺服器，而是意味著像計算能力這樣的資源會根據需要在背景自動配置。

The advantage here is that organizations won't pay for compute power unless they're running a query or application.
這裡的優勢是，除非組織正在運行查詢或應用程式，否則不需要為計算能力付費。

At its simplest definition, serverless means that businesses provide the code for whatever function they want and the public Cloud provider does everything else.
最簡單的定義是，無伺服器意味著企業提供他們想要的任何功能的代碼，而公共雲提供商則完成其他所有工作。

Imagine you provide software to businesses that help employees manage their corporate expenses.
想像一下，你為企業提供幫助員工管理公司開支的軟體。

You want to add a feature that lets users upload an image with their expense receipt.
你想添加一個功能，允許用戶上傳帶有開支收據的圖像。

In this case, the ability to upload an image is called a function.
在這種情況下，上傳圖像的能力稱為一個功能。

You as the software development company write the code for that function directly into your public Cloud platform.
作為軟體開發公司，你直接將該功能的代碼寫入公共雲平台。

From there, the public Cloud provider manages everything else.
從那裡開始，公共雲提供商管理其他所有事情。

One type of serverless computing solution is called function as a service.
一種無伺服器運算解決方案稱為函數即服務。

Some functions are a response to specific events, like file uploads to Cloud storage, or changes to database records.
一些功能是對特定事件的響應，例如上傳文件到雲存儲，或對數據庫記錄的更改。

You write the code that defines the response to those events and the Cloud provider does everything else.
你編寫定義這些事件響應的代碼，而雲提供商完成其他所有工作。

Google Cloud offers many serverless computing products.
Google Cloud 提供許多無伺服器運算產品。

The first is Cloud Run, which is a fully managed environment for running containerized applications.
第一個是 Cloud Run，這是一個用於運行容器化應用程式的完全管理環境。

With this product, you don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
使用這個產品，你不需要擔心底層基礎設施。

Then there is Cloud functions, which is the platform for hosting simple single purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your Cloud infrastructure and services.
然後是 Cloud Functions，這是一個平台，用於託管附加到從你的雲基礎設施和服務發出的事件的簡單單一用途功能。

For example, sending a notification to a mobile device when a new order is placed on a website.
例如，當網站上有新訂單時向移動設備發送通知。

There is also App Engine, which is a service to build and deploy web applications.
還有 App Engine，這是一個用於構建和部署 Web 應用程式的服務。

Serverless computing has many benefits, reduced operational costs.
無伺服器運算有許多好處，降低運營成本。

The Cloud provider is responsible for the infrastructure and its maintenance.
雲提供商負責基礎設施及其維護。

Therefore, the application owner does not need to invest in the infrastructure or the human resources required to manage it.
因此，應用程式所有者不需要投資基礎設施或管理它所需的人力資源。

Scalability.
可擴展性。

Serverless computing provides automatic scaling of computing resources based on the applications demand.
無伺服器運算根據應用程式需求自動擴展計算資源。

The Cloud provider manages the scaling process and the application owner only pays for the resources they use.
雲提供商管理擴展過程，應用程式所有者只需為他們使用的資源付費。

Faster time to market, the need for infrastructure, setup and configuration is eliminated, which reduces the time required to deploy applications.
更快的上市時間，消除了對基礎設施、設置和配置的需求，這減少了部署應用程式所需的時間。

This feature lets the application owner focus on writing code and quickly deploying new features.
這個特性讓應用程式所有者專注於編寫代碼和快速部署新功能。

Reduce development costs.
減少開發成本。

The development process is simplified because developers can focus on the application's logic and not on the underlying infrastructure.
開發過程得到簡化，因為開發人員可以專注於應用程式的邏輯而不是底層基礎設施。

Improved resilience.
提高彈性。

Serverless computing offers improved resilience and availability as the Cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure's failover and disaster recovery capabilities.
無伺服器運算提供了改進的彈性和可用性，因為雲提供商自動管理基礎設施的故障轉移和災難恢復能力。

Pay per use pricing model, The application owner only pays for the computing resources they use.
按使用付費的定價模式，應用程式所有者只為他們使用的計算資源付費。

This reduces the cost of unused resources and helps optimize costs.
這減少了未使用資源的成本並幫助優化成本。

How might an organization benefit from Cloud computing infrastructure technology?
組織如何從雲計算基礎設施技術中受益？

Let's explore an example specializing in educational technology.
讓我們探討一個專門從事教育技術的例子。

Mashme.io provides video collaboration experiences for over 3 million users in 73 countries.
Mashme.io 為 73 個國家的超過 300 萬用戶提供視頻協作體驗。

Connecting 250 full HD live video streams in real time is a major technical challenge.
實時連接 250 個全高清直播視頻流是一個主要的技術挑戰。

Latencies need to be kept very low to achieve the face to face experience, and continuous integration in deployment is vital to avoid disruptive downtime for global clients.
為了實現面對面的體驗，延遲需要保持非常低，而部署中的持續集成對於避免全球客戶的破壞性停機時間至關重要。

Meanwhile, costs have to be kept to a minimum to keep the solution affordable for a growing start up.
同時，成本必須保持最低，以使這個解決方案對於成長中的初創公司來說仍然負擔得起。

To meet those needs, Mashme.io chose to use Google Kubernetes Engine.
為了滿足這些需求，Mashme.io 選擇使用 Google Kubernetes Engine。

Every teacher we speak to tells us that latency is the most important thing for educational video conferencing.
我們交談過的每位教師都告訴我們，對於教育視頻會議來說，延遲是最重要的。

Says Mashme.io meet founder Victor Sanchez Belmar.
Mashme.io 的創始人 Victor Sanchez Belmar 說。

Low latency means having servers close to every student that connects to Mashme.io.
低延遲意味著要有服務器靠近每個連接到 Mashme.io 的學生。

With students connecting from around the world, Google Cloud has the global network to make that happen.
隨著來自世界各地的學生連接，Google Cloud 擁有實現這一目標的全球網絡。

The view was that setting up data centers around the world with your own hardware is a good way for a start up to never start.
普遍認為，用自己的硬件在世界各地建立數據中心是一個初創公司永遠無法開始的好方法。

Instead, Mashme.io started using Google's global network with App Engine before moving to Google Cloud with their own docker containers, and finally, to Google Kubernetes Engine.
相反，Mashme.io 最初使用 Google 的全球網絡和 App Engine，然後轉移到 Google Cloud 並使用自己的 docker 容器，最後轉移到 Google Kubernetes Engine。

This allowed them to update their nodes and services in an almost continuous way without disruption.
這使他們能夠以幾乎連續的方式更新他們的節點和服務，而不會造成中斷。

Students didn't lose an hour or even a second of class.
學生們沒有損失一小時甚至一秒鐘的課程時間。

## 4.2 Modernizing Applications in the Cloud

### 4.2.1 The benefits of modern cloud application development

Thanks to advances in cloud technology, the way that software applications are developed has drastically changed.
由於雲技術的進步，軟體應用程式的開發方式已經發生了巨大的變化。
With modern cloud application development, software development is flexible, scalable, and uses the latest cloud computing technologies to build and deploy applications.
通過現代雲應用程式開發，軟體開發變得靈活、可擴展，並使用最新的雲計算技術來構建和部署應用程式。
In the past, the traditional software development approach, often referred to as monolithic applications, required all the components of an application to be developed and deployed as a single, tightly coupled unit, typically using a single programming language.
過去，傳統的軟體開發方法，通常被稱為單體應用程式，要求應用程式的所有組件作為一個緊密耦合的單元進行開發和部署，通常使用單一的程式語言。
There are many benefits to the modern cloud application development approach.
現代雲應用程式開發方法有許多好處。
Let's explore a few.
讓我們探討幾個。
We'll begin with architecture.
我們將從架構開始。
Modern cloud applications are typically built as a collection of microservices.
現代雲應用程式通常被構建為一組微服務。
Microservices are independently deployable, scalable and maintainable components that can be used to build a wide range of applications.
微服務是可獨立部署、可擴展和可維護的組件，可用於構建各種應用程式。
This can help organizations bring business value to market faster because features can be released as they're completed without waiting for the rest of the application to be complete.
這可以幫助組織更快地將商業價值帶入市場，因為功能可以在完成時立即發布，而無需等待應用程式的其餘部分完成。
Regarding deployment, modern applications are typically deployed to the cloud and can use managed or partially managed services.
關於部署，現代應用程式通常部署到雲端，並可以使用管理或部分管理的服務。
Managed services take care of the day-to-day management of cloud-based infrastructure, such as patching, upgrades, and monitoring.
管理服務負責雲端基礎設施的日常管理，如修補、升級和監控。
This can free up staff to focus on other tasks, such as developing new applications.
這可以讓員工騰出時間專注於其他任務，如開發新應用程式。
Partially managed services offer a hybrid approach, where businesses manage some aspects of their cloud-based applications themselves and the cloud provider manages others.
部分管理的服務提供了一種混合方法，企業自己管理其雲端應用程式的某些方面，而雲提供商管理其他方面。
In terms of cost, modern cloud applications use a pay as you go pricing model, which can make them extremely cost effective when configured efficiently.
在成本方面，現代雲應用程式使用按需付費的定價模式，當配置得當時，這可以使它們極具成本效益。
That means that organizations don't always need to pay for resources they aren't fully utilizing.
這意味著組織不必總是為未充分利用的資源付費。
Developers can also use prebuilt APIs, which we'll explore later in this section of the course, and other tools offered by the cloud provider to build and deploy their applications quicker.
開發人員還可以使用預先構建的 API（我們將在本課程的後面部分探討）和雲提供商提供的其他工具，以更快地構建和部署他們的應用程式。
And then there's scalability.
還有可擴展性。
Modern cloud-based applications can easily be scaled up or down to meet user demands.
現代雲端應用程式可以輕鬆地擴大或縮小以滿足用戶需求。
Modern cloud applications are designed to be highly available and resilient with built in features like load balancing, which is the process of distributing network traffic evenly across multiple servers that support an application.
現代雲應用程式設計為高可用性和彈性，具有內置功能，如負載均衡，這是將網絡流量均勻分配到支持應用程式的多個服務器的過程。
And automatic failover, which is a process that allows a cloud-based application to automatically switch to a backup server if a failure occurs.
以及自動故障轉移，這是一個允許雲端應用程式在發生故障時自動切換到備用服務器的過程。
Additionally, cloud service providers typically offer robust monitoring and management tools that allow developers to quickly identify and respond to issues, which can further improve the reliability of cloud applications.
此外，雲服務提供商通常提供強大的監控和管理工具，允許開發人員快速識別和回應問題，這可以進一步提高雲應用程式的可靠性。

### 4.2.2 Rehosting legacy applications in the cloud

When a business decides to modernize and move its operations to the cloud, it might be running several specialized legacy applications that aren't compatible with cloud-native applications.
當企業決定現代化並將其業務遷移到雲端時，它可能正在運行幾個與雲原生應用程式不兼容的專門舊式應用程式。

In these situations, a business might take a rehost migration path, commonly referred to as lift and shift, where an application is moved from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment without making any changes to the application itself.
在這些情況下，企業可能會採取重新託管遷移路徑，通常稱為"提升和轉移"，即將應用程式從本地環境移動到雲環境，而不對應用程式本身進行任何更改。

Rehosting applications brings with it the many benefits of cloud computing that we explored earlier, such as cost savings, scalability, reliability, and security.
重新託管應用程式帶來了我們之前探討過的雲計算的許多好處，如成本節省、可擴展性、可靠性和安全性。

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to choosing a rehost migration path for legacy applications, including: Complexity: rehosting can be a complex process.
然而，為舊式應用程式選擇重新託管遷移路徑也有一些潛在的缺點，包括：複雜性：重新託管可能是一個複雜的過程。

Businesses need to carefully plan the migration process and ensure that they have the right resources in place.
企業需要仔細規劃遷移過程，並確保他們擁有適當的資源。

Risk: migrating applications to the cloud always involves some risk.
風險：將應用程式遷移到雲端總是涉及一些風險。

Businesses need to carefully assess and identify potential risks and ensure that they have a plan in place in case of any problems.
企業需要仔細評估和識別潛在風險，並確保他們有應對任何問題的計劃。

Vendor lock-in: by moving applications to the cloud, businesses might become locked into a particular cloud provider.
供應商鎖定：通過將應用程式遷移到雲端，企業可能會被鎖定在特定的雲提供商。

This can potentially make it difficult to switch providers later.
這可能會使未來更換提供商變得困難。

Google Cloud offers many solutions for rehosting specialized legacy applications.
Google Cloud 為重新託管專門的舊式應用程式提供了許多解決方案。

### 4.2.3 Application programming interfaces (APIs)

Implementing a software service can be complex and changeable.
實現軟體服務可能是複雜和多變的。

And if each software service that an organization uses has to be coded for each implementation, the result can be fragile and error-prone.
如果組織使用的每個軟體服務都必須為每次實施單獨編碼，結果可能會很脆弱且容易出錯。

One way to make things easier is to use APIs or application programming interfaces.
一種簡化方法是使用 API 或應用程式編程介面。

Earlier in this course, you saw how cloud providers offer a variety of resources and services for running applications and performing computational tasks in the cloud.
在本課程的早些時候，你看到了雲提供商如何提供各種資源和服務，用於在雲中運行應用程式和執行計算任務。

However, to fully use these resources and services, applications need to be able to interact with them in a standardized and efficient way.
然而，要充分利用這些資源和服務，應用程式需要能夠以標準化和高效的方式與它們互動。

This is where APIs come in.
這就是 API 的用武之地。

An API is a set of instructions that lets different software programs communicate with each other.
API 是一組讓不同軟體程式相互通信的指令集。

Think of it as an intermediary between two different programs, which provides a standardized and predictable way for them to exchange data and interact.
